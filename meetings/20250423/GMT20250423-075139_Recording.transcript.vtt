8
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:42.010
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Not so much, but I have some internal work.

9
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:51.469
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): as you know. This is the timing before the golden week in Japan, so we have matched our task

10
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.260
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): to down before the golden week.

11
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:05.980
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes, I I forgot. It was golden week. I was just looking at my calendar, and I realized, Oh.

12
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.400
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Many Japanese company will take holidays next week.

13
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.110
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes.

14
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.800
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah.

15
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:23.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So. But, as as you know, we need to finish the review about for the open society.

16
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.920
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yolov.

17
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.626
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Well, my plan next week. Is to

18
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:40.830
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): to take a little bit of golden week to have my own private onsense study group.

19
00:06:41.905 --> 00:06:44.110
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It's very good.

20
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:52.879
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I found to also in the timing at the open source time in Japan this year.

21
00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:00.670
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So not only Shane, but also the attendees. This study group. Please join us.

22
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.440
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): That's it.

23
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:10.220
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I will plan to go somewhere around the Hakone area in Japan at the before the Open Source Summit, Japan.

24
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.779
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So if you'd like to join. Please let me know.

25
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:22.559
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I will definitely definitely join. Hey, Thomas, I see you're online. Sandra's here

26
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:35.070
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): by Shelly's here. Some of you know what the Onsen study group is, some of you don't. But basically we're going to

27
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:46.819
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): go to somewhere lovely with Japanese hot springs at the time of the Open Compliance summit. So you are very welcome to come. If you are in the country.

28
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.381
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): it's the most popular study group in open chain. Actually

29
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.140
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): nary is here too.

30
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.640
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): And while the sun Hi! Gary, how are you?

31
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.090
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Hey, Yari, you mentioned yesterday that you're doing a podcast about M and A,

32
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.980
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): when, when you do that, can you send the link? So I can also promote it.

33
00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:25.190
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Unfortunately, it will be done in Finnish language, so that wouldn't help much.

34
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.160
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Oh, no, that's okay. That's good. I'm very.

35
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:28.660
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Okay.

36
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:28.965
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yeah.

37
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:50.879
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Alright. Yeah. Well, you know I will. It will be done with one legal company in Helsinki. And I don't know, because, like. 1st we do the recording on Thursday morning, and then later on, they will kind of cut, and, you know, do whatever they do it to to, you know. Make it 45Â min, or whatever long. But yeah, once that's done, you know I can. I can share the link, of course.

38
00:08:51.060 --> 00:09:02.870
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I would love that. I like the idea of promoting more international language events. Even if people cannot understand it. I think it's important to share that things are happening.

39
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.820
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Yep.

40
00:09:05.667 --> 00:09:13.210
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Kubota, Sam, will I open the meeting just with the antitrust notice, and then hand over sharing to you

41
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.190
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): orders and is muted. So I'm going to.

42
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.349
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Oh, sorry! Oh, is it?

43
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.049
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you. Yes, go ahead.

44
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.120
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Thank you.

45
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.760
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): No, sir.

46
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.350
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We have a busy meeting already. 13 people online. Okay.

47
00:09:37.560 --> 00:10:01.109
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): so welcome to another open chain study group meeting. This time. It is the Sbom Study group. This is one of our most busy and popular study groups in the project. We're talking about how Sboms can be used in production in very practical ways.

48
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:27.230
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): The leader of this study group. The chair is kobotasan from Sony, and he'll be guiding you through the discussion before he does. So. I'm just going to show our antitrust policy. Notice this meeting, like all of the meetings in the Linux Foundation, is held under our antitrust policy. Notice. You can read the full policy on our website.

49
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:39.709
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And if you're from a member company, you can ask any questions of our council and the up to Grove, if you're not from a member company, you can ask any questions of your own council.

50
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:54.410
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Well, with the formal part out of the way. We have a ton of exciting work to do around the practical use of Sboms in the supply chain, and I will hand over to Kubota-san to run the meeting.

51
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:04.649
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you, Shane. I will start today's meeting and wait a moment.

52
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.659
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I will share.

53
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, can you see my screen.

54
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.550
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes, it's looking good.

55
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:29.579
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you for attending today. And for the past 2 months is we have been discussing

56
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:34.070
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): the challenges of the S-bomb operation.

57
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:43.900
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And we have also been discussing how to solve these challenges and what kind of guide or documentation we should have.

58
00:11:44.460 --> 00:12:01.239
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So today, I will share the progress about it. And among Japan communities we had 5th time to discuss at the local meetings.

59
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.459
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And what kind of document we should have.

60
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:16.259
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So this is a very preliminary document and idea stage. So let me know, or let us know what you think.

61
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:27.280
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And we have already a good guide from the Terra S bomb guide on the open chain Project repository.

62
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:33.800
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So we think we should refer this guide as a baseline.

63
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:41.509
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): On the other hand, this guide is described only by using the Spdx format.

64
00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:50.750
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and in the past meeting we should, if we should create this guide, we should form a diagnostic

65
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:57.529
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the industry independent. It's an idea for our discussion in the past.

66
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:06.710
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So I and Japanese colleagues, Japanese folks created a table of contents today.

67
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:12.140
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And 1st one is a introduction about this document.

68
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:18.750
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It's a just interaction, and these are the chapter summaries

69
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:29.929
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): based on the Terraco Sbom guide objectives and scope is inherit this Terco spom guide.

70
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:43.110
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But, as I said, this guide is written in only about Spdx format, so we should define industry independent and format agnostic

71
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.460
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): style.

72
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:57.689
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and a second chapter is terms and definitions, and we added, we will, we should add a second Dx. About for the terms and definitions.

73
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:10.629
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the 3, rd 1 3rd chapter is explaining up the basic requirements. This is already described in the Chapter 3 requirements from open channel.

74
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:16.020
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so as same format we should.

75
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:22.720
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): as described on the X-plane, not only the Spdx, but also the Cyclone Dx, and so on.

76
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:31.460
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And I'd like we'd like to propose at a whole section

77
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:36.040
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): as from quality, assessment and improvement measures.

78
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:49.179
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The chapter systematically organizes specific check items and resolutions, resolutions for assessing, accessing and improving s bomb quality

79
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:57.870
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): based on issues discussed within the open chain, S-bom study group and the open chain. Japan, Sbom study group.

80
00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:06.580
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This item will be added, using the appendix to template for chapter 5 items.

81
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.020
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This one.

82
00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.260
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, sorry.

83
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.530
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Set up top 5 like this.

84
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.399
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So chapter title is challenge, title for example.

85
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.960
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): ensuring accurate and consistent information descriptors.

86
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.042
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This challenge is

87
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:43.969
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): already translated in English, and you can refer the materials. But some materials are later in Japanese. So I summarized in English

88
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.818
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): share, that is, shoes and

89
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:54.119
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): proposal solutions and automation considerations about each issues.

90
00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:20.170
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And we had a 5th time to discuss. So you can check several issues. And we believe this is just discussed within the Japanese communities. But we believe these issues are similar issues all over world companies or individuals. Should have similar issues, we think.

91
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:38.309
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And after adding these items, we back to the open center for Spom Guide, Guide management and administration.

92
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:43.309
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This chapter focuses on managing the this guide itself.

93
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:54.409
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): outlining regular reviews, updates and procedures for documenting change history rather than the operational management of the spont itself.

94
00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:06.409
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So guide update processes and defining guide update processes and change, history, management, and documentation. This is where we described in this chapter.

95
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:21.739
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the last one is reference and related materials. This is all also based on the open center request, form guide, and adding some another materials, such as Icon Dx specification, and so on.

96
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.140
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And it does.

97
00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.970
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Characteristic items. Is this one?

98
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:40.850
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Well during the discussion we had the idea less sample.

99
00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:48.500
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): especially for the endless Spdx examples for describing some

100
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:55.659
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): situation and actual Spdx, Jsons and second Dx. Jsons.

101
00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:08.730
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and we can find many samples by lighting with cyclone Dx format. But we can't find many, not so many Spdx examples

102
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.800
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): also, all over

103
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:27.560
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): more. We can find some Spdx as example with Spd. X version 3 point 3 or 2. But we can't find any examples letting in Spdx version 3 point. O,

104
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:37.400
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so we will add some actual examples, and adopting some regulations such as Nti minimum in

105
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:50.489
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): for adopting Sd. Ndi minimum element. We should like Spdx. 3 dot. O, we will share such examples in this chapter.

106
00:18:51.850 --> 00:19:00.140
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So that's the overview of the idea level of the as bomb quality guide.

107
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:08.889
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So I'd like to ask all of you. Are there any idea or comments about this.

108
00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:23.899
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And everyone feel free to unmute yourself or write it in the chat. I'm watching the Chat, Yari. Your hand is up.

109
00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:33.800
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Hey? Not really. Well, it's it's kind of related to this document as well. But idea.

110
00:19:34.947 --> 00:19:43.900
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Should we start to talk about S bomb, document quality kite instead of S bomb quality kite cause.

111
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:52.190
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): My thinking back, you know, is that okay, there's S bomb and the organization. Most likely they will have some sort of database

112
00:19:52.650 --> 00:20:09.020
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): that keeps the products product versions and then the open source and commercial and in house developed components in in database and then do the matching. And that's kind of the S bomb. And when they

113
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:16.170
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): final ship application or product, or whatever, then from that database they generate

114
00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:23.880
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Spom document, that, for example, they can, you know, ship together with that product, to make that sort of this

115
00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.680
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): kind of separation between those 2, that there's S. Bomb.

116
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:36.650
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): which is most likely some database, and you know fields in the database and tables, and then there's s per document

117
00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:43.509
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): which then could be Spdx or Cyclone Dx, or or maybe some other other format in in the future.

118
00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:52.675
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, thank you. I agree with your opinion. You are salt. Yes, we should.

119
00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.210
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): device, spom document quality guide.

120
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.149
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, I agree. Thank you.

121
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:07.440
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): I don't know if everybody else, you know, thinks this way, but I think this is not just my my thinking.

122
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.660
Vivek Kumar (Interlynk): Hello!

123
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:16.170
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes.

124
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:21.349
Vivek Kumar (Interlynk): Hi, hi! So I also wanted to suggest one thing. So what about adding

125
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:27.830
Vivek Kumar (Interlynk): one more topic there? Why, good quality S bomb matters and how it can help.

126
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:33.549
Vivek Kumar (Interlynk): And what are the standards of good quality? S. Bombs.

127
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.850
Vivek Kumar (Interlynk): Kind of.

128
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:42.219
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, sorry. I missed to implement.

129
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:53.830
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes. During our Japanese discussion we should define. What is quality referring? The

130
00:21:54.220 --> 00:22:14.220
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): yes, exactly in Sbom Qs documentation that is described that describing what is the Sbom document quality. So we should refer that as one, the definition of the Sbom quality.

131
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:25.220
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah. So we will write down implement. Such a Sbom call Sbom document quality definition into this guy.

132
00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.200
Vivek Kumar (Interlynk): Yeah, okay.

133
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:31.660
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much.

134
00:22:32.815 --> 00:22:33.970
Vivek Kumar (Interlynk): Yeah.

135
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.369
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Are there any other salts or opinion.

136
00:22:51.380 --> 00:23:01.290
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And just to stress for everyone any thoughts, any opinion is very welcome. This is a study group. So we're brainstorming at this stage.

137
00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:16.560
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And when we've had all of our studying done later, we will perhaps become a work group and do the work part. So now is the brainstorm and any comment, any idea is very welcome.

138
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.480
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Rakesh.

139
00:23:23.785 --> 00:23:37.275
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): Yeah, thank you. Shane. So just couple of points, I think. There was this point regarding the current guide focus only on the Spdex and not on the cyclone. Deeks. Right?

140
00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:50.340
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): So do we also intend to add the cyclone. Dx. You know specification, best practice, like, what are the parameters that should be part of cyclondix? Document.

141
00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:57.230
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Appendix. One, I think. Is that right, Kubota Sam, where we will have the samples.

142
00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:11.050
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, but as you know, we don't have enough experience using. So I I will very appreciate

143
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:15.350
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Conditions from the psychologist people.

144
00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.490
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): Okay?

145
00:24:18.224 --> 00:24:31.629
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): So so what what are the expectations? Is it? With respect to let's say, what are the parameters that are man that should be mandatory be part of a cyclonics document

146
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.850
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): for it to be qualified as a you know a good S. Pop. Is that the expectation.

147
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:46.049
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So there is something underway. Oh, sorry, Kubota! Sam.

148
00:24:47.908 --> 00:24:50.910
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Sorry. Go ahead, please. I'm not.

149
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:55.720
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah. I I can't forward the question exactly. Sorry.

150
00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:03.010
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Well, I do have an answer which might suit you, Rakesh, which is based on

151
00:25:03.622 --> 00:25:11.120
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): what type of s bomb we might like to see in that. So what is it? What is it we might want to see?

152
00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:12.550
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And

153
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:26.200
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I made an issue, I think. Yes, this is an issue. So it hasn't been accepted yet. Okay, but it's an example. I'm just going to share my screen. Briefly, if that's okay.

154
00:25:27.256 --> 00:25:29.869
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and then I'll come back to Kubota Sand.

155
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:33.159
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So I'm just gonna share my screen and show you an.

156
00:25:33.605 --> 00:25:34.050
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes!

157
00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.280
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Thank you.

158
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:48.850
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): This is an issue that's open on Github about this document. And right now we have a small bit of text saying, there'll be S bomb samples. And I just suggested that we have

159
00:25:48.970 --> 00:26:06.950
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): these type of samples like, what is the minimum in Spdx you need for ntia and cyclone for ntia. Then later, once we have the rules. What's the minimum in Spdx for Cra and cyclone for Cra?

160
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:16.630
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And then what is it for? Nta plus cra. What fields do you need in Spdx? Same question, what fields do you need in cyclone?

161
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:23.090
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So those type of really practical examples are what my proposal is my suggestion.

162
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:33.109
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I don't know if that answers your question, Rakesh, but it's just an example of you know, very practical. What what type of thing might be useful for us to create.

163
00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:52.279
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): Yes, yes, I think that is, that is also quite helpful. but I think we should have this appendix part that you had mentioned. Additionally, one more point is like in an ideal scenario. When there is an Spd when there's a spom exchange

164
00:26:53.174 --> 00:27:02.830
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): and if if the S bomb is being, let's say, generated in one country, and then it's going to another country where, let's say, from India to Europe.

165
00:27:03.358 --> 00:27:20.920
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): Then, you know, the adherence has to be with respect to the Cra and other laws, and similarly, in us, we would be having other requirements. Right? So I would also suggest, if everyone agrees. Could we have, like a combination of

166
00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:26.971
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): all in one s form, because currently, I think the N. The Nta is quite familiar

167
00:27:27.792 --> 00:27:49.377
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): and the cra is quite new. So I would say, like the last 2 examples that you mentioned right? Npa plus cra, maybe we could also try to bring in other parts. So if we have let's say, my idea is that we could have Cra separately. You could have Nta separately, and maybe you could have BSI separately. That's fine.

168
00:27:49.710 --> 00:28:03.169
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): But then, when we merge it? Probably you could have like a combination of everything rather than like you know, having like 6 to 7 different combinations, because that would also be like a little difficult right

169
00:28:04.946 --> 00:28:06.579
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): to to refer. I mean.

170
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:21.290
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yeah, no, absolutely. I I mean, I don't think we can do all of the edge cases in examples. Certainly we should probably do the really big office ones. So you know us India, Europe.

171
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:29.220
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And if we could do like the isolated example, here's Ntia. It's I don't know. 14 fields.

172
00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.130
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): Yes.

173
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:54.230
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): But then have the combined example of here's ntia plus cra plus an Indian requirement. This is what it looks like. I mean, that's exactly the type of really useful contribution that hopefully experts such as yourself could help us with as we build the appendix, because you're right doing the simplest one would only be useful like a code snippet. It's like, here's a tiny example.

174
00:28:54.490 --> 00:29:03.119
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): But combining India, us and Europe suddenly would give a real practical example for the market. Of course.

175
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:03.810
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): Right?

176
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.720
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): Right?

177
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:06.480
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): Yeah, sure.

178
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.071
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Sounds like a please help us. Community moment.

179
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:32.069
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): No, no problem. I think, yeah, I mean, just a suggestion like, because that sounds more like like, how the suppliers work, or if somebody is consuming it's probably generated somewhere, and it's being consumed somewhere and probably the person who's generating may have to. Let's say, adhere to multiple laws.

180
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:38.210
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): So yeah, it will be good to have that definitely. We'll also try to contribute here as much as possible.

181
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.790
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): Thank you.

182
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:46.389
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Thank you. It'll be great to have you help with the appendix examples.

183
00:29:50.583 --> 00:29:54.530
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): We have a question from yarisen.

184
00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:01.320
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, it's a we should discuss about the packs

185
00:30:02.356 --> 00:30:13.260
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Spdx already. Have a security profile, and I heard that at least starting I they are now at least starting to discuss about how to

186
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:23.579
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): embedded style or separated style, how to involve and growth into the s. 1.

187
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:35.170
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But I'm not sure we should include this guide about Bex information in this guide.

188
00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:39.579
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Are there any thoughts? Do you have any thoughts, Yarisan?

189
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:53.020
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): I, I yeah, like, that's why I threw the question out there. Because I think as for today, the industry is still

190
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.090
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): kind of debating a little bit about the embedded bags or not.

191
00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:03.990
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): and I think that as for today, mostly

192
00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:12.150
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): they are favoring the separate fax from S. Bomb, but who knows

193
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:24.469
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): what we will say in in 6 or 12 months from now, that if if the industry will go for the embedded vex, and then, if it's embedded, and then we if we have the S bomb quality kite, then I think it

194
00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:31.850
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): maybe should be part of the document. If if the industry is going towards the embedded fix, but

195
00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:36.210
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): I think we will see that, you know, in in the coming months or years.

196
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:50.629
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah, thank you very much. Yes, we had. In Japanese community, we had a similar discussion. And currently Japanese community tends to choose a separated style.

197
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.947
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But I'm not sure what the way we're going.

198
00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:00.770
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Yeah. And, for example, in Germany, the BSI guide, it's clearly at least the

199
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:04.489
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): 1st iteration. Say that they must be separated.

200
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:06.850
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

201
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:07.850
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): I say, yeah.

202
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:11.120
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Then, on the other hand, the cyclone cyclone is is, you know, I think, push.

203
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:11.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Not yet.

204
00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:16.000
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): More towards the embed model, so I don't know.

205
00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:18.938
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, Shane, please.

206
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:39.829
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I just had a thought which was the advantage of what we're doing is because we're building a guide. And it's not. It's not a specification. It's not formal guidance. It's no problem for us to expand or change the guide for market conditions.

207
00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.290
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So

208
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:52.909
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): you know, we, if if currently things are separate, and then if people bring them together, I think it's no problem for us to say, Okay, we'll make a new version of the guide. Now

209
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:54.709
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the industry change.

210
00:32:56.361 --> 00:33:03.430
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah, it's a good idea. Just we share. We should share the example in appendix one.

211
00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:18.449
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But this is a separate and also you. If you want to embed a free slide like this, we can share the such example in the other appendix.

212
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.400
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It's a good idea.

213
00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:27.190
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I love that idea because that means people can just sit down and explore.

214
00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.800
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): Could we also add, the schema along with the examples

215
00:33:39.345 --> 00:33:42.702
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, also really cool, because then we could define like

216
00:33:45.308 --> 00:33:54.300
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): yes, thank you. It's idea, I think. But as far as I know Spdx team are discussing about it.

217
00:33:54.670 --> 00:34:00.280
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): say, creating some schema about Spdx 3 dot. O, currently.

218
00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:20.120
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So we can join the as we, I'm not sure but we should join the Spdx team and discuss simultaneously, and reflecting the Spd schema to this guy as a sample or answer.

219
00:34:21.735 --> 00:34:22.360
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): Okay.

220
00:34:24.459 --> 00:34:31.409
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And I'm not sure. But are there any schema in the Cyclone Dx format.

221
00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:45.880
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): So. I'm I'm pretty sure I think. We discussed on maybe 2, 2 months back we discussed on the Sapia project. You're aware of that right?

222
00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:46.549
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh!

223
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.090
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): So.

224
00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:47.580
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

225
00:34:47.942 --> 00:35:00.250
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): This is also in the open chain, and so the purpose of the project is to provide a validator of this bomb and also collect different schemas.

226
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:07.020
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): So currently, it's like, since it's initiated from Bosch. We have, added the schema.

227
00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:12.400
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): just as a let's say, a best practice thing kind of a thing like it's more like a draft.

228
00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:17.319
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): So maybe if this could also be referred

229
00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:21.608
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): so it's available for both Spdx and cyclone. Dx.

230
00:35:22.458 --> 00:35:26.639
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): svdx 2 dot 3 and cyclone dx one dot 4.

231
00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:28.840
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): So I just added the link here.

232
00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.470
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This one. Okay?

233
00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.750
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, okay.

234
00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:44.070
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, that's great.

235
00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:48.850
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

236
00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.710
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay?

237
00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:00.220
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, great. Thank you for sharing.

238
00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.879
Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited): Yeah, you're welcome.

239
00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:12.079
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, yours. Oh, yours are good. Okay.

240
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:20.920
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): okay. Are there any thoughts or questions? And so on?

241
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.290
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Nothing.

242
00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:43.808
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay? Then I will create. Create move this top guide

243
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:50.295
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): to the open chain, spom, study, group repository and

244
00:36:52.200 --> 00:37:03.779
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): welcome to create issues or some discussions, items and so on. So please join. Please continue on the discussion on the Github.

245
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:09.389
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): because time zone is different. So

246
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:12.960
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): very welcome to create the issues and so on.

247
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:28.200
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, so we have time. So I will introduce some items this time.

248
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:37.280
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So 1st challenge is is ensuring accurate and consistent information descriptions.

249
00:37:38.278 --> 00:37:42.760
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): We've already discussed about this in the past meeting.

250
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:54.539
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But there are challenges in the inconsistent representation of information. It's the content of the Spdx and sbon value.

251
00:37:55.330 --> 00:38:09.429
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): such as package names are sometimes different. Also, it's a it's almost same. Packages or version representation is some kind of different format.

252
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:23.869
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): in some cases just only 2 dot 3, but some package described as A, B 2 dot, 2 dot, 3, and so, and supplier names across different companies and tools.

253
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:41.799
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): These are the sharing shared challenges. And we describe how to improvement how to improve these situations. This should be described ideal situation, ideal environment.

254
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:46.510
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And after that, how to solve this situation.

255
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.330
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and how to evaluate the improvement of these challenges.

256
00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:59.040
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Another thing we should describe. If we

257
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:07.430
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): try to improve this situation. But there are, there may be still

258
00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:17.980
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): some risks or considerations. So we should describe these risks and considerations in these sub chapters.

259
00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:25.510
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the second challenge is that standardization and the normalization of component granularity.

260
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:45.109
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is sometimes we received the Spom document described in the package level, but some part or some 3rd party provide this spom document in more detailed document.

261
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.949
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): such as a file level document.

262
00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:57.929
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): In some. In such case we needed to merge the package level s 1 and a file level. s. 1.

263
00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:06.670
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): She's a barely burden to much systems or engineers tasks.

264
00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:10.316
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So how to solve. Well, we will

265
00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:15.769
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): describe such situation to how to solve such situations.

266
00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:22.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the 3rd one is complementing source information, enhancing transparency.

267
00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:37.040
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): What is this? Specify? Essential items, such as a listing source files, hash parties or license information implement providing binaries and a set process that of the automated instruction process.

268
00:40:37.941 --> 00:40:47.880
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Sorry. I'm not sure this question, this challenge. So we need. I I will check the past our discussions

269
00:40:49.260 --> 00:41:08.509
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and strengthening. 4, th one is strengthening partner ability, integration and risk management. This is somewhat related to the Pecs define methods for linking component information with primary data such as Cbe and introduce automated mapping for risk assessment

270
00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:17.188
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and to clarify how data is incorporated into experimentaries and determine definitive conclusions.

271
00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:29.239
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): What is this? Sorry. I forgot. Also forgot this item. But we definitely discussed in the past.

272
00:41:31.267 --> 00:41:34.610
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The okay, it's a

273
00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:54.980
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): not important. So please check it later. These items if you are interested in. So if you do like to know more details, we, I already linked this document. So please check it later.

274
00:41:56.870 --> 00:42:03.450
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, okay, we have 30Â min, but I have no idea.

275
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:06.910
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So please. Shane, thank you. Please go ahead.

276
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:15.100
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We have one question in from Vilma, which is about, will the corresponding open source

277
00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:20.039
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): licenses of software elements be part of Sboms?

278
00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:25.939
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Or will this be separate to fulfill with Iso 5, 2, 3, 0 compliance.

279
00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:33.490
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Now this is a discussion, I think, for the wider group. But I just wanted to, you know. Be very

280
00:42:34.299 --> 00:42:41.969
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): quick. Note that Iso 5, 2, 3, 0 requires that people identify the licenses of code.

281
00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.659
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and they obey the licenses.

282
00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:53.590
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It's not prescriptive. The the Iso standard isn't prescriptive about how to do that.

283
00:42:55.160 --> 00:43:00.650
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So Iso 5, 2, 3, 0 compliance means that you're

284
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:09.100
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): having a process to identify the licenses and to meet their requirements. And Iso, 5, 2, 3, 0 stops there.

285
00:43:09.956 --> 00:43:13.440
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It doesn't talk about how to do that.

286
00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:21.050
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So I just wanted to put that in context, and then and then the question would be, You know, how do

287
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:29.759
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): corresponding open source licenses be part of S bombs, and the answer is.

288
00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:41.780
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I think, generally all of the major Sbom formats identify the or can identify the license of a corresponding package.

289
00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:48.820
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): But people would have to make sure that their tools and records do that and keep the record.

290
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.200
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yari, over to you.

291
00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:56.809
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Just a little note that there was some

292
00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:06.530
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): oh, actually, not just quite a lot of discussion on Fsfe's legal network mailing list about a topic. That

293
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:16.010
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): is it enough for license compliance just to send the S bomb or not? And

294
00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:24.930
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): there were quite a lot of legal people joining the discussion. And I think that the conclusion was that

295
00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:32.170
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): just having the S bomb, even with the license information, is not

296
00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:41.680
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): fulfilling the requirement. But I think that discussion is still going on so fsf, fees, legal network

297
00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:43.510
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): mailing list discussion.

298
00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:45.980
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Right.

299
00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:50.130
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And I mean, I guess one of the things

300
00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:57.880
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): that's very important is that if we talk about an Sbom format it describes how to say something.

301
00:44:58.556 --> 00:45:03.359
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): If we talk about an Sbom quality guide, it's saying that

302
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:06.190
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): we want you to say something

303
00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:10.809
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and say these things. You know, we. We want a certain amount of stuff.

304
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:15.449
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): but neither an Sborm format or an Sbom quality guide

305
00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:22.950
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): is a guarantee of compliance. So companies have to understand the licenses and the requirements.

306
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.770
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and for that reason, having an S bomb

307
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:31.599
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): in any format Spdx or cyclone

308
00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:37.559
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): doesn't mean that you're meeting a license requirement. It just means you have some data written down.

309
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:40.340
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and an Sbom quality guide

310
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:51.010
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): requires you to have something in the S bomb. It's like, have this field and that field and this field. So it's more likely that you'll meet various requirements.

311
00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:56.619
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): But it's not a guarantee that you'll meet the requirements of every open source license.

312
00:45:56.890 --> 00:46:10.490
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So I think it's like these are tools. But they're not ways to have no responsibility. So it's we can reduce the burden, and we can make the industry have one alignment.

313
00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.340
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): But we we can't make

314
00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:25.449
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): license compliance requirements go away for companies. If that makes sense, you know, there's there's no easy answer to it. Someone has to check that. They're meeting the requirements.

315
00:46:26.507 --> 00:46:35.030
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Ninjoji-sen had a question, an interesting question. Can you explain the relationship between this S Bomb Quality Guide and the Telco Guide.

316
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:44.410
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): For me this guide does not seem to cover all the points in the Telco Guide. What is the difference between the 2. I'm curious about the reason.

317
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:51.030
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): komodo-san, would it be okay if I said something about this? Or do you want to jump straight in.

318
00:46:53.218 --> 00:46:57.410
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): both are okay. But I will try to explain

319
00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:04.066
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): as I okay, okay, as I explained of initial

320
00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:25.810
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): in short, timing of these meetings. We have already the good Telco Spom guide. So, but the Telco S bomb guide is only describing about Spdx format and focusing to use within the telco industry.

321
00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.250
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So

322
00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:48.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): of course, we should, based on inherits as from guide, but we should extend it sometimes extend, extended and sometimes reduced or modified as necessary to suit industry, independent and hormone diagnostic style.

323
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:53.659
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is a difference between the 2 main difference between the 2,

324
00:47:54.640 --> 00:48:15.199
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and also, we discussed the actual challenges and issues among documents in actual our industries. So we we'd like to add some situation challenging situation and how to solve

325
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:17.750
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): these situations.

326
00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:27.060
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And then, lastly, we'd like to add actual s 1 sample later in Json format

327
00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.229
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): for the Cyclone and Spdx.

328
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:36.699
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): These are the main differences between the 2. Are there any additional comments shared.

329
00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:59.029
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Oh, I think you've covered it better than I could. And I guess you know. Another additional context is just that the Telco guide is already in use with companies such as Nokia and Ericsson for their sector. So they're already busy with this. It's deployed. It's being used.

330
00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:09.030
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So what we're doing is separate as exactly as Kubota sense, said Cross. Industry focused on what we're up to.

331
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:16.989
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So it's it's a different game. Their guide is already out. It's already done. It's already focused on one industry.

332
00:49:17.706 --> 00:49:22.830
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We can be inspired by it. But we have slightly different job to accomplish.

333
00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:26.869
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So yeah, just as Comboto's hand said.

334
00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:32.350
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah, I need your son.

335
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:33.999
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Are you okay?

336
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:43.390
Takashi Ninjouji: Thank you so much for your explanation with the I'm little bit confusing, because

337
00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:51.200
Takashi Ninjouji: yes, exactly so. The S. How to say the open chain. Tech s. 1 guides.

338
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:55.526
Takashi Ninjouji: It's titled with the words terraco, but

339
00:49:56.670 --> 00:50:00.969
Takashi Ninjouji: according to the contents of turquote from guide.

340
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:12.909
Takashi Ninjouji: it seems for me, at least for me. So it doesn't matter specifically onto the Telco industry. The

341
00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:22.190
Takashi Ninjouji: how to describing things is that's popular things to treat the S-bom.

342
00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:31.609
Takashi Ninjouji: So if we no, no, if we open chain or this Sbom study groups

343
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:36.589
Takashi Ninjouji: would like to make a standard. It is not

344
00:50:37.485 --> 00:50:50.470
Takashi Ninjouji: sorry it is across the industrial or industry neutral guide it can be, use the almost whole contents

345
00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:53.240
Takashi Ninjouji: from the technical Sm guide.

346
00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:58.200
Takashi Ninjouji: But the apparently this is from quality guys.

347
00:50:59.332 --> 00:51:04.600
Takashi Ninjouji: How to say, show the

348
00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:13.820
Takashi Ninjouji: different style. And this different structure of this document, and at some points it is opioids

349
00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:18.380
Takashi Ninjouji: only in this document, but under otherwise

350
00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:24.200
Takashi Ninjouji: some topics is like from the Sbom. Sorry, Telco Sbom guide.

351
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:33.269
Takashi Ninjouji: So I'm a little bit confusing. Why, these topics is not how to say. On aligned these 2 guides.

352
00:51:36.084 --> 00:51:46.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'm not sure. I delivered all contents of the open gender quest. Bomb guide they are of.

353
00:51:46.430 --> 00:52:01.080
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): for example, scope is objectives, and scope refers to the scope section and the terms and definitions. Yeah, we we should refer.

354
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:12.160
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And after that requirements, we should, we will refer in the 3rd section chapter 3.

355
00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:14.130
Takashi Ninjouji: Hmm.

356
00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:22.829
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So there are no differences, but we will, of course, add some Sbdx, 3 dot O or cyclone Dx format.

357
00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:32.390
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But basically I intended to live. All of the contents from the open channel spam, guide.

358
00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:33.990
Takashi Ninjouji: Oh, really.

359
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:35.910
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes.

360
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:38.849
Takashi Ninjouji: Might be my fault. But the

361
00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:44.990
Takashi Ninjouji: No.

362
00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:54.949
Takashi Ninjouji: okay. So the better.

363
00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:58.149
Takashi Ninjouji: In the Telequestimo guide there is a

364
00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:06.600
Takashi Ninjouji: something discussion about the expo module, 3.12 estimate.

365
00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:12.210
Takashi Ninjouji: But there is no discussion in the this Espon courty guide.

366
00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:18.080
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It's on March here on this one.

367
00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:18.960
Takashi Ninjouji: Yeah.

368
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:30.200
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, I will. I don't intend such things. I will refer all of section 3 from the Telco Spoonkai.

369
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.819
Takashi Ninjouji: So you koto.

370
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.120
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes.

371
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:48.960
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): sorry. I'm not sure to describe all chapters in the in this draft, but I will inherit. Section 3, all of section 3. From the Turkish Muqai.

372
00:53:48.960 --> 00:54:00.490
Takashi Ninjouji: So if you want to use this open chains, new s. 1 quality guide, we should also check the open s. 1 guide.

373
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:02.150
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): No, it'll be.

374
00:54:03.935 --> 00:54:04.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Sorry.

375
00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:05.560
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It'll be copy, paste.

376
00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:06.020
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Sorry Shane.

377
00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:06.620
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Bye.

378
00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:21.450
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Sorry. I was just saying the the text will be copy pasted inside, so you won't need both documents in your hand.

379
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:25.350
Takashi Ninjouji: Hmm.

380
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:31.640
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah, sorry, Jimmy.

381
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:38.009
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Can you speak out I can't understand what you're out with here.

382
00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:43.855
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): Oh, yes, yep, so I I can speak up. And and as to the name of

383
00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:51.034
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): Telco Spom Guide, I do agree that it's it's more

384
00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:59.449
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): let's say, more broader than just Telco, but we never found a better name for it than

385
00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:05.190
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): than than Telco. So that's so. There's no specific requirements

386
00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:08.679
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): to teleco. I think that the requirements in the Spom

387
00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:12.730
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): Guide there, or probably applicable to more industries

388
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:20.990
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): it it's also proved useful to calling it Telco Spom Guide to get adoption, at least in

389
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:24.449
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): in the Telco industry. But there's

390
00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:35.520
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): I. I don't think it should be viewed as a telco. Only thing as you as you point to in Yujitan. It's it's the requirements are applicable to to more industries than just Telco.

391
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:46.830
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, you sound. Are you okay? Or do you have any salts?

392
00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:52.490
Takashi Ninjouji: Thank you so much for your comments, Jimmy and Kupitasan.

393
00:55:55.240 --> 00:56:01.230
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, Hi, this is just a idea to love it

394
00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:24.640
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so. But I all of Japanese community, including ninjas. But listen. You can't join the our discussions, unfortunately, but we don't intend any. We don't intend to remove specific chapters. We all based on the.

395
00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:34.259
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): but we think we also think we needed to modify from the industry, independent from a diagnostic perspective.

396
00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:41.379
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So we will modify telequest from guide such from the such perspective.

397
00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:47.870
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But we will defer all sections, all chapters about from the telequest book guide.

398
00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:55.229
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this is just a at this moment. This is just a guide, not specification, not guideline.

399
00:56:56.060 --> 00:57:11.580
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So we will. We'd like to start just sharing the best practices and the best solution, or some actual examples in the world to the all industries, communities.

400
00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:35.729
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Perhaps one last note is that Telco is deeply involved in helping with this as well. So we're synchronized with market on chair of telco

401
00:57:36.539 --> 00:57:42.459
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): but you know to your point in Joji Sen, we should make sure that 1st of all.

402
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:56.920
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): there's nothing contradictory about the guides. Second of all, you. You don't need to read both documents. You can choose one or the other. And then finally to Kubodistan's Point

403
00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.300
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): that the

404
00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:11.230
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Cross Industry Cross Format guide has a slightly wider scope because it won't do anything specific to Telco, but it will also include other Sbom formats and so on.

405
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:19.829
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, yeah, I just raised my hand because.

406
00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:23.361
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): You know. As as for discuss that this is

407
00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:29.730
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): like brainstorming a little bit. So thinking out loud.

408
00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:39.410
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): should or could we add a chapter that would describe or say that the audience of this guide.

409
00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:48.019
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): for example, that this could be for the tooling people, for the users of Spom, for the

410
00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:54.380
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): people who are generating S. Bombs, etc. Etc. Or would that be just noise on this document?

411
00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:08.149
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I have one questions do you intend to create some separate requirements or some items for

412
00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:10.819
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): each each audience?

413
00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:18.180
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Do you intend to separate some requirements for each audience.

414
00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:26.860
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): I think it would be similar.

415
00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:34.220
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): But the take, for example, for the I don't know. The sea people could be a little bit different

416
00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:39.800
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): than, for example, just the ones who are consuming S bombs

417
00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:48.770
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): because they are, you know, responsible of generating S bombs. And then there's some some folks who are consuming, so they might have a little bit different.

418
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:53.630
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): View to the guide.

419
00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:56.430
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah.

420
00:59:56.430 --> 01:00:01.249
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): But I don't know if it adds any value to to. Let's say, pinpoint that. Okay.

421
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:06.998
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Mr. Mrs. S. Bomb generator. Look at this, and then

422
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:11.720
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): consumer, you know. Maybe you have another.

423
01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.950
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Not the point. I don't know. Maybe it's just at at noise.

424
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:16.990
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes.

425
01:00:17.899 --> 01:00:29.859
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): thank you for your idea. Yes, it's good idea. But it's a little difficult. Yes, we will discuss about that. Yeah.

426
01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.919
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): thank you very much.

427
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:38.609
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay. We had 8Â min last.

428
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:45.540
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Are there any other questions or salt.

429
01:00:46.116 --> 01:00:51.879
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I have some news in that. Alan Friedman from

430
01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.570
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Cisa has expressed interest in what we're doing.

431
01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:00.240
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and he wants to know more about

432
01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:11.560
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the type of Sbom work we're doing. The 1st thing he wants is a presentation about the Telco Guide during the Cisa weekly meeting.

433
01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:18.620
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So I just wanted to flag that this is something that's upcoming, and

434
01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:25.719
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): hopefully we'll be able to get Cesa to informally give us some notes as well.

435
01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.850
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I believe if I'm correct.

436
01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:35.850
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Jimmy, you're going to join the Cisa. Call to

437
01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:40.850
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): to do the briefing, if if and when Alan schedules it.

438
01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:50.110
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): Yes, that's the intent, at least if and when he schedules it, and either if it's me, or if it's Mark, or if I

439
01:01:50.270 --> 01:02:08.189
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): give a little bit of historical overview, having started the things thing once upon once upon a time, or if if Mark does that, then I'm just there for sort of more of supporting context. But I think it's very encouraging to have someone like Alan reaching out wanting to know more, and I I no doubt that sort of

440
01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:17.099
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): once we in that group touched upon the Telecos poem, I mean, this work is that we're doing here in the Eth Bomb study group is is highly

441
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:21.740
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): relevance. I would assume that he would have a an interest in that as well.

442
01:02:25.690 --> 01:02:29.717
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So I just wanted to flag that because it's cool.

443
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:35.089
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): Yeah. To be honest, I was a bit starstruck when when I saw that email.

444
01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:43.400
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yeah, it's it's it's really good. And Alan is, you know, such a nice person he's great to work with. It's going to be.

445
01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:45.860
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It's gonna be really good for us.

446
01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:58.178
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): No pressure. Kubota, son.

447
01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:05.630
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): If available. Could you share the meeting schedule.

448
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:06.040
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Farewell!

449
01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:11.450
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah, thank you. I will attend as just the audience.

450
01:03:13.221 --> 01:03:18.519
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It's it's during some crazy time for us in Japan. I'll bring you in to see

451
01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:27.859
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It's on that particular thing. It just it just happened this week. An email came in from Alan asking for a briefing.

452
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:32.390
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So include you on that. And let's see.

453
01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:44.630
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): you know, they want to know about Telco Guide. I'm sure they'll be very interested that we're looking at cross industry, and I'd love if Sisa might join one of our calls to give us a briefing on their work.

454
01:03:49.121 --> 01:03:59.160
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, we have one chat one question in a chat box. I also interested in this question from Stefan.

455
01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:10.959
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah, she says. As for mail list is very silent recently. So we are very worrying, worrying about that.

456
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:17.922
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But it's difficult to share in this meeting.

457
01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.679
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I think.

458
01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:33.019
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yeah, we'll, you know. We'll we'll find out. What happens, I guess, over the next few months it's going to. It's gonna take a while for things to settle down.

459
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:37.819
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): But I believe that we should have more certainty

460
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:43.790
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): about the Us. Government in approximately one month.

461
01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:58.660
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): because that's the point where the initial phase of Elon Musk's activity with his department of Government efficiency will have completed its task, and at that point it'll be more clear.

462
01:04:59.402 --> 01:05:03.730
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): What has been cut, what stays, etc, etc.

463
01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.499
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you.

464
01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:19.339
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, okay, that's almost time to finish this meeting.

465
01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.919
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you for attending. All of our guides.

466
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:27.229
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Have any comment. Last comment from Shang.

467
01:05:27.810 --> 01:05:38.189
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I just wanted to say Thank you for a wonderful meeting and so many helpful questions and ideas. And you know, I think Joji Sen raised a really important

468
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:42.200
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): clarification. What are we doing this for? How does it work?

469
01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:47.180
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I think we had some great suggestions from our friends at Bosch about

470
01:05:47.450 --> 01:06:01.909
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): format examples. You know what a great meet this is, what community is all about sharing ideas, brainstorming, agreeing, disagreeing, finding new things. This is why this is why it's fun to work together.

471
01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:24.220
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you very much. Okay, okay, thank you for attending our overviews. And I'm looking forward to seeing you at the open Source Summit in North America at the in June.

472
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:27.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you very much.

473
01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.040
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): Right? Okay, forward to it.

474
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:30.330
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you.

475
01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:31.449
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Have a good day.
