00:07:14	Thomas Hühn:	Good morning! I'm just watching a bit. :-)
00:25:23	Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project):	Should we talk also about VEX (embedded or not) also in this guide?
00:25:40	Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation):	https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/OpenChain-JWG/issues/377

00:40:30	Vilma:	Will the correspondent OSS licenses of Software elements be part of the SBOMs or will this be separate to fulfill with the ISO 5230 for OSS Compliance?
00:44:24	Takashi Ninjouji:	Could you explain the relationship between this SBOM Quality Guide and the Telco Guide?
For me, this guide does not seem to cover all the points in the Telco Guide. What is the difference between two? I'm curious about the reason for this.
I apologize if this has already been discussed. It's been a while since I've participated in discussions related to SBOM.
00:46:24	Vilma:	So they should be linked in a way...
00:50:53	Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson):	Agreed, the Telco part could be omitted from the name, we just never figured out a better name for it....

01:03:17	Stephen Pollard:	Is there any wider info on the future of CISA in the times of DOGE?

I was thinking that too.
