### Overall Summary

The meeting of the Open Chain SBOM Study Group, chaired by Norio Kobota from Sony Group Corporation, focused on the progress of a **new SBOM Quality Guide**. This guide is being developed by the Open Chain Japan communities and aims to be **industry-independent and format-agnostic**, building upon the existing Open Chain Telco SBOM Guide. The goal is to create a practical document covering the challenges of SBOM operations and proposing solutions, including providing actual SBOM examples in different formats.

### Discussion

Several attendees raised questions and offered ideas regarding the content and scope of the new guide ([SBOM _Document_ Quality Guide draft TOC](./20250423/SBOM-Quality-Guide-TOC.en.md)):

*   **Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project)**:
    *   **Question/Idea:** Suggested renaming the document to "SBOM document quality guide" to distinguish the generated document from the underlying database/data.
    *   **Response/Discussion:** Norio Kobota agreed with this suggestion.
    *   **Question:** Asked if the guide should discuss **VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange)**, specifically whether it should be embedded within the SBOM or kept separate.
    *   **Response/Discussion:** Norio Kobota noted that the SPDX team is discussing this, and the Japanese community currently leans towards a separated style, but he was unsure if it should be included in this guide. Jari mentioned that the BSI guide in Germany requires separation, while CycloneDX might push for an embedded model. Shane Coughlan suggested the guide could be updated later if the industry standard changes, or could show examples of both separate and embedded VEX.

*   **Vivek Kumar (Interlynk)**:
    *   **Suggestion:** Proposed adding a topic explaining **why good quality SBOM matters**, how it helps, and defining the standards for good quality SBOMs.
    *   **Response/Discussion:** Norio Kobota agreed and said they should define quality by referring to the SBOM QS documentation from Interlynk.

*   **Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited)**:
    *   **Question:** Asked if the guide intends to include information about **CycloneDX**, specifically mandatory parameters and best practices, since the existing Telco guide focuses only on SPDX.
    *   **Response/Discussion:** Shane Coughlan suggested including **practical examples** showing the minimum fields required for regulations like NTIA and CRA in both SPDX and CycloneDX formats.
    *   **Suggestion:** Recommended providing **combined examples** demonstrating SBOMs that meet the requirements of multiple regulations (e.g., NTIA + CRA + an Indian requirement). Shane welcomed contributions for such complex examples from community experts.
    *   **Question:** Asked if **schemas** could be added along with the examples.
    *   **Response/Discussion:** Norio Kobota mentioned the SPDX team is working on schemas for SPDX 3.0 and suggested they could potentially join that discussion. Rakesh shared a link to the **OpenChain SBOM-sg-SEPIA project's schema repository** which includes schemas for SPDX 2.3 and CycloneDX 1.4.

*   **Vilma**:
    *   **Question:** Asked if **OSS licenses** should be part of SBOMs or separate to fulfill ISO 5230 compliance.
    *   **Response/Discussion:** Shane Coughlan clarified that ISO 5230 requires license identification but doesn't specify how, and that major SBOM formats can generally include license information. Jari Koivisto noted that legal discussions suggest an SBOM alone may not be sufficient for compliance. Shane emphasized that SBOMs and quality guides are tools for documenting data, but do not guarantee compliance with all license requirements; companies still need to understand the licenses and obligations.

*   **Takashi Ninjouji**:
    *   **Doubt/Question:** Expressed confusion about the relationship between the Telco SBOM Guide and the new SBOM Quality Guide, noting apparent differences in structure and content (like the omission of a discussion on SBOM merger) and questioning if the new guide fully inherits from the Telco guide.
    *   **Response/Discussion:** Norio Kobota clarified that the intention is to **inherit all of section 3 from the Telco Guide** and incorporate it into the new guide, with modifications made only to achieve an industry-independent and format-agnostic perspective. Shane confirmed the relevant text would be copied over, so users wouldn't need both documents. Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson) added that the requirements in the Telco guide are generally applicable beyond the Telco industry despite its name. Shane reassured that the guides would not be contradictory and the new guide would have a slightly wider scope.

*   **Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project)**:
    *   **Suggestion:** Proposed adding a chapter describing the **intended audience** of the guide (e.g., tooling developers, SBOM generators, consumers).
    *   **Response/Discussion:** Norio Kobota found this a good idea but potentially difficult, stating they would discuss it further.

*   **Stephen Pollard**:
    *   **Question:** Asked if there was wider information about the future of CISA in the context of DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency).
    *   **Response/Discussion:** Shane Coughlan mentioned that more clarity on the US government landscape might be expected in about one month, following the initial phase of related activities.

### Results and TODOs:

Based on the discussion, the following points were generally agreed upon:

*   The name of the document will be revised to "SBOM document quality guide".
*   The new guide will be **industry-independent and format-agnostic**.
*   It will build upon and **inherit content (specifically Section 3)** from the existing Telco SBOM Guide, modifying it for the broader scope. The content will be copied so both documents are not needed.
*   The guide will include **actual SBOM samples** in JSON format for both CycloneDX and SPDX.
*   These samples will include examples relevant to **regulatory requirements**, such as NTIA and CRA. Examples showing **combined requirements** from multiple regions (e.g., US, Europe, India) would be valuable additions.
*   Including **schemas** along with examples is a good idea. Existing resources like the SEPIA project's schema repository can be referenced.
*   The guide is currently at an **idea/draft stage** and serves to share best practices and examples, not as a formal specification.
*   **CISA has expressed interest** in the Telco Guide.

**Points for Continued Discussion / Future Work**

The conversation highlighted several areas that require further deliberation or development:

*   Whether and how to include information about **VEX** (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange), particularly addressing the debate between embedded and separated styles.
*   The feasibility and value of defining different **requirements or perspectives for different audiences** (e.g., SBOM generators vs. consumers) within the guide.
*   Monitoring and understanding the evolving landscape of **US government cybersecurity initiatives**.  
*   How to best integrate or reference **schemas** for different SBOM formats, especially newer versions like SPDX 3.0, as they are developed.
*   The broader legal interpretation of whether an SBOM, even with license information, is sufficient to meet **license compliance requirements**.
*   Developing the detailed content for challenges in SBOM operations (such as inconsistent data representation and granularity differences) and their proposed solutions, automation considerations, and associated risks.
*   Clarifying and documenting how data is incorporated into SBOM metrics and used to determine definitive conclusions.
