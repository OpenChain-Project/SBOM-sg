9
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.720
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Can everyone see my screen?

10
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.090
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yes?

11
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.540
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Dude.

12
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:58.330
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, I pasted the URL for today's, material, materials, so if you want, please, check it.

13
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.780
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

14
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:15.019
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, I will start today's meeting, and thank you for joining. And, today, as I already mentioned in the mail list.

15
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:20.320
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'll be sharing our participation in Hostem 2026.

16
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:30.840
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And a related event, like, About Code Workshop in Brazil, the beginning of this month, and the, last day of the last month.

17
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:47.409
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, before we begin, I needed to address the antitrust policy notice. Linux Foundation meetings involve industry competitors.

18
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:54.239
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, all activities must comprise applicable antitrust and competition laws.

19
00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:01.300
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, attendees must adhere to meeting agendas and avoid any prohibited activities.

20
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:08.990
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the Linux Foundation Antitrust policy is available at the provided, URL.

21
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:16.439
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And if you have any questions, please contact your company counselor or Andrew at the globe.

22
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.110
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

23
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:35.750
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, our first major, event was, host license and security compliance tools workshop, aka, About Code of Power, workshop, held at the HostEM 2026 fringe event.

24
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:45.920
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this workshop was designed, the secret design to facilitate dialogue, between tools, developers and users.

25
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:59.929
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And by sharing development plans and practical feedback, participants identified synergies to enhance the lifecycle of SBOM creation and utilization.

26
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:07.300
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): If interested, you can find more details at, about Code Event website.

27
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.360
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): From the link here.

28
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:18.120
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, the About Good workshop consisted, Of three parts.

29
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): first one, OSS to repeat,

30
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:29.320
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): A conference on current challenges, and a keynote from prominent developers.

31
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:35.089
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the key message I, like, recognized was, striking.

32
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:40.850
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The OSS community has no obligation to fix vulnerabilities.

33
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.419
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): That's always about response, no.

34
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.759
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And with the Cyber Legitiance Act approaching.

35
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.060
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Relying on sorry, on the community for security patches is now a waiter risk.

36
00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:08.220
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): We, as corporate employees, must shift from being male users to active contributors who take ownership of vulnerability fixes.

37
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:19.900
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, our priority is improving internal processes and building a development framework that correlates directly with OSS communities.

38
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.810
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It's, my understanding for this workshop overall.

39
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:39.420
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the next one is Hostem 2026. Our focus is areas where S form on the supply chain, and CRA in practice, and for me, legal and policy development.

40
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.979
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And not… these, reports are not comprehensive, so please…

41
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.619
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Jump in to talk anything you want to ask.

42
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.020
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

43
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:59.040
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Lastly, let me share some practical insights about attending Hostem as a first-time attendees.

44
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:06.200
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, the event takes place at ULV, a massive junior hectare campus.

45
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:14.630
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And since there are a few nearby hotels, most attendees commute 30 minutes from the city center.

46
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:26.400
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, we prepared for packed buses and trams. Actually, I missed trams and buses next day, second day.

47
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:38.890
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, buying lunch can be difficult due to crowds, so we highly, I highly recommend, bringing our own food and drinks instead.

48
00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:47.200
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the opening keynote had over 1,0500 people.

49
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:55.229
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the community, stands were extremely crowded throughout the event, like the hotels.

50
00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:03.489
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this is very impressive for me as a first-time attendee.

51
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:08.749
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The heart of Hostem lies in what we call the hallway truck.

52
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:17.380
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Why was the opening keynote on digital sovereignty and democracy drew thousands?

53
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.930
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): From over 1,0500 attendees.

54
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.300
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The real value is happening in the corridors.

55
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:36.530
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this is a massive, autonomous ecosystem with over 1,000 sessions and 100 plus community stands.

56
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:42.680
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): All operated by volunteers and provided free of charge.

57
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:51.699
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And also, they are providing custom Wi-Fi to the privacy focus matrix protocol.

58
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:56.510
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And everything is built by the community, all the community.

59
00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:06.180
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): On-site, we can see the students, executives, and families discussing open source as equals.

60
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.239
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It's very surprising for me, as one Japanese.

61
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:18.830
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And it's clear that OSS, open source software, is no longer just a tool.

62
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:25.270
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It's an essential social infrastructure nurturing Europa's next generation.

63
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:34.429
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this experience provided me the vital importance of touching the question of the open source community around firsthand.

64
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:41.169
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, this is the most surprising thing for first time attending one Japanese.

65
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.799
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, first three, Liga and the Porsche W.

66
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:59.210
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It really feels like, 2026, with full CRA enhancement just around the corner.

67
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.230
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The legal and Portugal balloon was packed, list this year.

68
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:14.649
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Despite the difficult legal nature of discussion, the organizers seem to be genuinely enjoying themselves.

69
00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:27.690
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And I had, I had the opportunity to have a breakfast with, Matiasan from the Free Software Foundation Europe, one of the development organizers.

70
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:45.660
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): to discuss topics, like the… this is not the topics related to the SBOM, but we are now discussing translation of Ada and Zengman. So, it was a great way to start the day before, diving into the legal session.

71
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:55.039
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And from the, legal and policy development, one interesting topic I'd like to share.

72
00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:03.710
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Los Alan Liu-san presented, from, I forgot, from the Taiwan.

73
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:23.830
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): presented an analysis of how Taiwan's open source movement evolved from its 1919 salutes into a force for digital democracy through Ji Zhao Bui Gov and the 2014 Sunflower Movement.

74
00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:39.270
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): However, she highlighted that Taiwan now faces a strategic mismatch between its ideas and the hardware economy due to fragmented narratives and across cost

75
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.010
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Transparency and, subling technology.

76
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:48.800
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, this was a fascinating case study in open source autocracy.

77
00:17:49.150 --> 00:18:01.699
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, I believe some of today's attendees involved in the to-do activity, or assessing business, but it's more important, I feel.

78
00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:20.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, also, we Japanese had a strategic deep dive meeting with, NOishi… from, Muto-san from NOishi, and, Ito-san from Lunetas.

79
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:25.080
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, they are, from Open Chain Japan, communities.

80
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:33.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And regarding the ECRIPS Foundation's ORC Working Group and the CRA, its CRA impact.

81
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.569
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And our discussion covered three strategic pillars.

82
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:46.490
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the first one is alignment, defining roles of CRA versus, ECRIPS ORC working group.

83
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:53.639
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the second one is responsibility, analyzing supply chain impact and liability.

84
00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:01.010
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the last one is implementation, moving from SBOM theory to practical automation.

85
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:07.779
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the technical focus areas included granularity of dependency tracking.

86
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:14.930
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and Evidence Documentation Standard, and the synergy with ORC and OpenChain SBOM working group.

87
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:21.720
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So… I'd like to say, one call to action.

88
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:36.819
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Community leads and corporate hospitals should lead these cross-industry, cross-community initiatives, and escalate these findings to executives inside our company.

89
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:42.049
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, two drive, four driving, compliance readiness.

90
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.780
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It's our, my findings.

91
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the next one is, S-bomb Deal.

92
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:59.570
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): We attended, all-day SBOM session held in, Risabito Auditorium.

93
00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:08.449
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): As expected, and many, people, many friends mentioned me, the venue was very packed.

94
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.880
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): While we could enter easily during early morning hours.

95
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:19.260
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But after the, landed at the noon.

96
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:27.670
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Once we stepped out, getting back in meant, significant, significant, waiting time.

97
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:36.210
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Among participants, I only saw a few acquaintances from Japan.

98
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:45.469
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Which made me feel that greater participation from the Asian community, especially from Japan community, would be valuable.

99
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:56.570
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, today, and thank you for joining, the first session was by Anthony Haison-san, whom I finally met in person.

100
00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:14.219
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, I'm sorry, due to terrain congestion, I couldn't join in real time. Actually, I joined, SBOM dev room. It's just the last slide of, Ansel Nu-san's presentation.

101
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.679
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But I watched the recording,

102
00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.660
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): after returning, returning to Japan.

103
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:30.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, while Builder SBOM? Many communities and many, developers are discussing Build S-bomb.

104
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.070
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Currently.

105
00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:37.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But his talk highlighted why deployed S forms are so essential.

106
00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:45.370
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This distinction is crucial for practical S-bombing implementation, I feel.

107
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:51.239
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, up here, Asunisan, do you have any comment?

108
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:57.040
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): No, hello?

109
00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.330
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Just Can you hear me?

110
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:00.830
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, can you hear me?

111
00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:08.530
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Yeah, okay, no, I think I wanted to highlight the differences of, the different types of SBOM.

112
00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.650
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): And I think…

113
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:19.770
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): when we move towards vulnerabilities, we need more information, and that's why I think the deployed SPOM is important.

114
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.690
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): So, I, you know, I welcome the community to support that and see what they think.

115
00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.349
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): It's part of our journey.

116
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.770
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Nope.

117
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:38.630
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): So, yeah, I mean, I think… I think there's a lot of… there's still a lot of…

118
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:43.289
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): experience still to be found in terms of maturing the SBOM tooling.

119
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:48.030
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I think we're still struggling, to be honest.

120
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:53.659
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I think I just wanted to put something out there to see what people… people thought.

121
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.199
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Aung Sun, I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

122
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.040
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Hello? Can you hear me?

123
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.370
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes.

124
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:16.259
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Yeah, okay, I'm, I'm, I'm on, I'm in the, in the… a big office.

125
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.000
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I don't know whether my headphones are working.

126
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.330
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): No, bro.

127
00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:28.870
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): But no, please reach out to me and carry on the conversation. I don't really, I think we've got a lot to… a lot to do in the next,

128
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.009
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): The next year.

129
00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.809
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): So that's really mature the tubing.

130
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.450
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Okay.

131
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you.

134
00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:06.269
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, this session is provided by Maruta-san, and, this session shared real-world efforts to operationalize,

135
00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:12.409
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): S-bombs generated by Carnell, Yocto, and Sefer.

136
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:22.740
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The primary challenge is the format disparity between embedded focused S forms using SPDX or CyconeDX.

137
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:26.730
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And information lost during conversion.

138
00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:40.880
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Missing package names or versions sometimes occur, and it leads to incomplete dependency mapping and inaccurate vulnerability analysis.

139
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:56.740
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The speakers recommended prioritizing native SVOM output from tools and cross-checking combative data across multiple scanners to verify integrity.

140
00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:07.920
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The session emphasized the ongoing need for community-driven interoperability improvement and integrated testing.

141
00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:17.819
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the next one is, CRL lady S-bones, provided… I'm sorry, I…

142
00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.209
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): From the LEGO HUD team.

143
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:32.369
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, these sessions emphasize the pragmatic 30-minute start approach, over legal idealism or perfection.

144
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:40.509
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): While it offers a great first step for immediate GRA alignment.

145
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:46.740
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But, I have a little bit of concerns about the lack of supply chain consideration.

146
00:25:48.020 --> 00:26:00.710
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The approach focuses on individual artifacts, potentially overlooking deeper dependency risks, and upstream verification required for true supply chain security.

147
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:08.859
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is an area, we, as the OpenChain S1 Working Group, need to address further.

148
00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:21.890
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the next one is, session… Sorry, this session was provided by the LEGO team, and

149
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:31.810
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The session had, suggested applying the use of SPDX relationships, such as, descendant of

150
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.560
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): To clarify the origin of the package.

151
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.620
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And they actually used, toca contenera?

152
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.770
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And a base container and built images.

153
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:49.359
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And define career boundaries of, its responsibility.

154
00:26:50.510 --> 00:27:02.019
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It was, very interesting for me to hear this, as it is a topic discussed in the actual, our SVOM Document Quality Guide.

155
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:08.380
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): When considering the entire software supply chain between different parties.

156
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:18.530
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, I, asked some… several questions after this, session to, Alexa from, My thought.

157
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.900
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, continue to discuss on the lengthy.

158
00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:23.940
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

159
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:30.219
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the next one is, Conforma.

160
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:42.320
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This session will focus on conforming a policy engine that automatically validates SMS and attestation generated in the software supply chain.

161
00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:53.309
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And it provides pass-fail judgment in pipelines, software pipeline pipelines, along with human LEW violation details.

162
00:27:53.930 --> 00:28:05.210
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the presentation included both the mechanism and a live demonstration. It is, great, great things for…

163
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:11.490
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And when I shared this with the Japanese community.

164
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:17.020
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): we… I learned about a similar tool called OPA,

165
00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:31.839
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): which is being utilized in, AGL Assessment Automation, AAA. So, if you have, any, questions, you can ask, AAA people.

166
00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:35.809
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): For Japanese, it's niju-san knows well.

167
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:42.760
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, I will check both, Conforma and, OPN now.

168
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:56.940
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, this session introduced Kernel S-bomb, generating, using SPDX budget on 3.0.1.

169
00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:14.520
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): From our knowledge, Yocto and Kernel are the currently among the most accurate tools for representing, producing SPDX version 3.0.1.

170
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:21.370
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): However, I observed some challenges regarding true interoperability.

171
00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:25.729
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, I asked that question, in… during this session.

172
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:31.790
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And for instance, build options are documented in the comment field.

173
00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:44.250
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Which could lead to information loss during format conversations between different tools or different formats, such as SPDX2, Cycle DX, and so on.

174
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:53.259
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is also an area that needs further definement or further discussion, or…

175
00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:05.429
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And one more thing. After returning to Japan, I was introduced to this session, and I watched the recording.

176
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:15.320
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The presenter, using Python, discussed how it's crucial. We are, extremely challenging.

177
00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:21.069
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): To trace dependencies, not just at the package manager level.

178
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:27.270
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But all the way down to the she or she prosperous layer.

179
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:38.050
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is, recognized as a major challenge within, especially within, Alpuncheon Japan study group as well.

180
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.150
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Subgroup as well.

181
00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:45.870
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, I'm very curious if authors in the community are here.

182
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.649
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): See, it's the same way or not.

183
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:53.049
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the last one.

184
00:30:53.440 --> 00:31:03.509
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I was presently surprised to run into Victoria's son and Jonathan from CISA at the About Code workshop.

185
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:14.130
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, we learned that, CISA SBOM, they, provided 2025 August, and so, maybe.

186
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:22.419
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, they, they… Might receive a lot of, comments.

187
00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.900
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): public comment.

188
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:28.850
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But, we don't see any activities from the CISA.

189
00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:37.460
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But, I asked them, and they are, they deprived, they are working now hard to respond to public comment.

190
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:42.160
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And in April, they want to release a new budget.

191
00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.929
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, this is an important development for SBOM standardization, I feel.

192
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

193
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.759
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): That's a shorter, summary for me.

194
00:31:54.980 --> 00:32:03.440
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But, I think there are many people from, who are attending the hostel in Basel.

195
00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:07.849
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Are there anyone to make a comment or make a talk?

196
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.970
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, I'm not saying it's not freeze.

197
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:21.690
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Guess, if I may,

198
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:38.829
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Because, I don't know, Kubota-san, you were not there on Wednesday yet, right? Because I can share that in the chat. There was this very, very nice GWeb Summit, the general… no, Global Vulnerability Intelligence Platform Summit.

199
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:48.760
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): So, I think it would be worth to have a look into these, activities. It was very, very interesting, because it also shed a light on

200
00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:53.739
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): So if you look at… some, some slides are already shared there.

201
00:32:53.770 --> 00:33:07.129
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): also Philip was there, also the CISA guys, the NISA guys were there, and that, was very great, because first of all, it was highlighting, okay, the SBOM is not really helpful at the end.

202
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:16.709
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): If we do not have these unique identifiers, right, because we need to enrich them with the metadata for the vulnerabilities, that's point number one.

203
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:28.899
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): point number two, and that fits to the last, slide that, that, Kobotassan showed with this, phantom dependencies. That's even worse, because you have those,

204
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.790
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Dependencies that have no maintainers.

205
00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:44.879
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): And, and they showed also in the, in this summit also some, values there from, metrics over the last year, so that there, we…

206
00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:56.229
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): we're on the good side, right? If we have our SBOM and we detect, okay, cool, all those dependencies, they are maintained, and we have health things, etc, but there was a huge amount, a huge percentage of

207
00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:06.859
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): of dependencies where there is no maintainer, and that will be a big, big problem, also for all this cybersecurity stuff. So there was no solution

208
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:20.879
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): But it highlighted some of the challenges that we have in the future, so that was very interesting. And also, I think what was very, very interesting was this vulnerability exploitability.

209
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:34.110
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): thing, so with this, you might have heard about is WEX, right? Vulbability Exploitability Exchange, because on the one side, then once you have this SBOM, also, as Anthony showed, right, so that's cool to have that, and you have this full

210
00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:39.839
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): overview, then ideally, if this is a runtime, SBOM,

211
00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:56.400
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): But that, then only your problems start, right? Because then you may, make vulnerability monitoring, then a week later, you get new vulnerabilities, and then you have to judge, okay,

212
00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:11.409
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): is… are they relevant or not? Are they exploitable in your specific case? Yeah, that's… that's already a challenge. But what… and this is what I learned now from this GWEP summit, and also the Code of Compliance that was on…

213
00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:22.420
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): on Thursday, so that there is now, not only cybersecurity challenge, but as soon as this,

214
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.969
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Thr,

215
00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:42.599
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): how is it called? This shred, level, yeah, so you have this, vulnerability scores, right, the CVSS, and this was also a big discussion here. As soon as this score is going beyond a certain limit.

216
00:35:42.600 --> 00:36:02.180
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): then you have to, by law, you have to react, and then you come into a compliance area. And I think Philip, he also highlighted that very well in the workshop. So, so far, in the past, it was not only, okay, you have an intrinsic motivation to get rid of your vulnerabilities, right?

217
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:16.369
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): now you also have this additional compliance motivation, okay? The higher, your severity of your vulnerabilities are, then you have to react… you have to react by law, and… and that's…

218
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:35.030
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): also brought up the discussion, so, hmm, well, well, then who decides about this, about this score, right? So these were discussions in here, so a lot of things, and that was a very, very good discussion also. And it was good, because it was a really nice series to have

219
00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:48.040
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): first day, this summit on Wednesday. On Thursday, then there was this code and compliance, so maybe I can also share that, because that was also… may be interesting

220
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:51.509
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): For some of you that also

221
00:36:51.780 --> 00:37:04.579
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Here it is, Code and Compliance Program, that is, about the supply chain taking also small and medium business into account.

222
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:24.269
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): plus the maintainer's perspective, yeah, so that was a very, very good, mix of, maintainers plus industry plus public sector in here. And also here, what Kobotassan already mentioned, that was mainly the ORC working group.

223
00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:38.199
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): And this is good because the ORC working group now makes kind of a bracket around all things, because Ule Johansson, who is also organizing, who was organizing this,

224
00:37:38.450 --> 00:38:01.550
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Global Vulnerability Intelligence Platform Summit. He's also part of this ORC working group, right? So here's where everything comes together, so I was really now pleased to see that, Kupo Jasan, you and your Japanese representatives were also meeting with the ORC Working Group, because I think here I can only second that here we should really join forces

225
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.059
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): With… with them, plus also the…

226
00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:10.719
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): The general vulnerability and challenges platform, and the good thing is that Uli Jornsen is from Sweden.

227
00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:25.669
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Jimmy was also in this event, who is also from Sweden, so our chair of the board, and then we already talked to Oliver, where I said, okay, hey, couldn't we use also our guides and our ISO

228
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:42.819
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): 18974 something to also, lever that into our supply chains, and he said, well, that might be good discussions. And he also synced already with, with Jimmy what we potentially can do in the future also to.

229
00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:46.030
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Yeah, to collaborate more on that level.

230
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:48.960
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much.

231
00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:50.740
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

232
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.600
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes. I heard these are, these…

233
00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:09.790
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): events have been held in Brussels, but unfortunately, I can't join from the January 29th, no, 30th.

234
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:22.319
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, next year, I'd like to join, or I will catch up, this, event, with leading these materials.

235
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:23.939
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you for sharing.

236
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.749
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Yeah, and, and we, we should, then anyway, I, I hope…

237
00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:41.620
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Yeah, that's… I was fortunate, because a colleague of mine was hinting into that, and said, okay, I had the chance to come one day earlier, but I think that should not be a problem.

238
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:44.750
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Because I would really love to have Ulinden

239
00:39:44.750 --> 00:40:06.080
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Ole Janssen, and also inviting him here, for example, into this round. He already joined the tooling group last time, yeah, to see, because they were searching for tools, and I told him, hey, we have tools. So they also planned to have… to create a list of open source tools, and said, yeah, then we should join forces, because we already

240
00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:15.069
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): maintain that list, and we can… we're open to extend that. So that's one point. On the other side, I think it would be really a very…

241
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:32.009
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): good addition here to our working group also to get this cybersecurity insights from, from his, community here. As Yogesh Mitel from Red Hat, for example, Andrei Lukashenkov there was, then also

242
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:46.610
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): giving this, this great, overview of, he made this, this, these metrics, et cetera, et cetera. So, a lot of, interesting perspectives, coming in, and I think it would be really.

243
00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:54.269
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): And I guess they would also be open to join us and also giving talks in here, and share their insights, yeah.

244
00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:04.530
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much. And, I feel, fortunately, we have many people, who are organizing this kind of events.

245
00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:17.229
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Like, today I see Nikola-san, and, Yu Master-san, and, Market Jin-san, and, Ari is also one organizer for the About Code workshop.

246
00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:27.760
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, we, OpenChain, are very, fortunate, fortunate, I, I'd like to say, we are very lucky.

247
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:34.710
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): To contact such people, to exchange the information and the insights.

248
00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:44.830
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, and I'd like to ask Arling, to your insight about the… about Code Workshop on the song.

249
00:41:49.710 --> 00:42:08.969
Alin Jerpelea (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you, Kuwat Hassan. I think that the, about Quad workshop showed a lot of, differences between the tool providers and what the both commercial and open source tools are providing from both the compliance and the SBOM output.

250
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:12.359
Alin Jerpelea (Sony Group Corporation): And what people actually need.

251
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:25.110
Alin Jerpelea (Sony Group Corporation): We had, in one of the workshops, around 30 people, which were sharing their experience with tools, and when they have been asked which tools they use.

252
00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:34.689
Alin Jerpelea (Sony Group Corporation): None of them was using one tool. All of them were using two or more tools, because the output from one tool was not enough.

253
00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:40.580
Alin Jerpelea (Sony Group Corporation): Depending on the project, and then depending on their use case.

254
00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:58.319
Alin Jerpelea (Sony Group Corporation): Another thing that I think that is worth mentioning is the fact that everybody complained about the fact that the tools do not provide an output which can be reused by a different tool. And that is, in my opinion, a bit concerning.

255
00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.750
Alin Jerpelea (Sony Group Corporation): So maybe, we should focus on…

256
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:15.959
Alin Jerpelea (Sony Group Corporation): Talking with the tool providers, and aligning on specific versions, which should be long-term support, like the kernel, like all the major projects that we have.

257
00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:20.950
Alin Jerpelea (Sony Group Corporation): And then, for the minor versions, each tool can use whatever.

258
00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:24.290
Alin Jerpelea (Sony Group Corporation): That's just something that… Came to my mind.

259
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:29.299
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay. Thank you, Audi.

260
00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:39.689
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): on the… Oh, thank you. Some more questions on… do you have any insight? Could you provide your insight?

261
00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:53.450
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yes, one, one information, during FOSDAM, I met with, Augustine Bettino Betancour.

262
00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.220
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Hmm, who is a consultant?

263
00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:11.879
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): He had worked previously at Scan OSS, but he's now an independent consultant. And, he proposed to make a presentation of the software HashID.

264
00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:25.170
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Software HashID, was developed by the Software Heritage Project, and it's a way to, identify, software components.

265
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:42.999
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So, he will, present, Software Rashidi in our next, meeting of the telco, workgroup, beginning of, March. It will be, the 5th of March.

266
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:47.779
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So I will, I will send, an email to…

267
00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:53.170
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): To remind you, this, presentation,

268
00:44:53.710 --> 00:45:00.409
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): That can be interesting, for both the telco workgroup and the SBOM workgroup.

269
00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:11.779
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much. I will. I must join. But next week, I will go to U.S, so I'm not sure I can join the telephone.

270
00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:15.279
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): It's not… it's not the next week, it's the week after.

271
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:19.319
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, okay. Oh, that's great. Okay, that sounds nice.

272
00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:25.910
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you very much. And a new person, could you provide your perspective?

273
00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:48.380
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): Yeah, I mean, the perspective… the perspective probably, falls in line with most of whatever was said, here. To me, something that comes to mind is actually two pictures of the four that you're currently showing on the screen. On the screen, one is the same conference session that we had, and just…

274
00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.019
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): Trying to figure out…

275
00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:56.609
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): What people technically use, just in terms of tooling, because for me, the interest… the interest

276
00:45:56.610 --> 00:46:20.640
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): for this workshops, especially for the workshop, was not just, the tools, but what people use, different, views, or different use cases for the different tools, and generally, the whole idea behind their supply chain. But, we had an interesting, fallback discussion after this with a few of the people from this round.

277
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:36.700
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): And it just surprises me that a lot of people from different companies are not heavily reliant on open source tooling. They might have, like, one or two tools in their supply chain, but they still heavily rely on

278
00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.950
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): On proprietary tooling.

279
00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:58.690
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): The other thing that we have, I had a really, really long discussion with Luid Adolfo, because not just the Ampo tool that he presented at the workshop, but also, he's maintainer of a few other tools that I'm particularly interested in. One of them is the Protobomb.

280
00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:05.279
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): So we had this discussion with him for, for possible synergies regarding the SEPIA project, and…

281
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:11.080
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): Some sort of collaboration in terms of… of what we can do to automate,

282
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:17.479
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): and integrate API into, or perhaps some SCA tools as a sort of a POC.

283
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:24.650
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): In a way. And perhaps an interest in… into the upcoming open chain in France, and a possible,

284
00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:26.779
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): Participation there, as well.

285
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:40.000
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): So, yeah, that's mostly it in terms of the tooling workshop. Yeah, I spend most of my day, during the SPOM dev room, in the dev room, so a lot of, yeah.

286
00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:56.740
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): fallback discussions with different people afterwards. And I think that we also successfully managed as ambassadors to drive a lot of new people to the different working groups that, and activity, not just people, but… but contribution as well.

287
00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:00.929
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): So, I think that's the input, I think, on my end.

288
00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.710
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah, thank you very much.

289
00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:07.580
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes. -Oh.

290
00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:18.599
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'm, I communicate with, about, Protobomb, and, I will continue to discuss about, protobomb.

291
00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.890
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): development also.

292
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:28.070
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, ice.

293
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:31.950
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Itosan, do you have any insight?

294
00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:33.490
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): can provide it.

295
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.580
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): Whoa.

296
00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:40.190
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): -Oh.

297
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:41.149
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I can't hear you.

298
00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:43.819
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): Can you hear me?

299
00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.870
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, I can hear you.

300
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:46.550
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): Earlier.

301
00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:49.060
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): Thank you so much.

302
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.180
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): this…

303
00:48:50.280 --> 00:49:01.700
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): I attended the, two years ago on the, several, years, in, this, 5 years, 7 years.

304
00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:08.180
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): And the… I've… So, that the… Many, they bloom.

305
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:14.679
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): on the… For today, mentioned in… mentioned about the CLA and the S1.

306
00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:21.350
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): However, two years ago, It's from this cushion of…

307
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:27.240
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): held just one dead room, as I… Remember, and

308
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:37.149
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): In that time, the rare, case study sessions and, best, best practice, sessions,

309
00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:46.479
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): And, many discussion, had, mentioned that the future effect of the…

310
00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:50.439
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): SBOM, how to… how we treat SPOM and,

311
00:49:51.070 --> 00:50:02.000
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): how we, connect SPOM with the, license compliance and, vulnerability information. But,

312
00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:08.450
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): VCU's, sessions, many sessions,

313
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.379
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): Discussing about the, some sort of case study.

314
00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:20.120
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): so, it's quite, interesting, to, to, to, to…

315
00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:24.660
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): The point of view from, real business.

316
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:27.920
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): engineering, a point.

317
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.070
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): So cute.

318
00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:35.870
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): However, relatively, yeah.

319
00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:49.600
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): So, not so many, future discussions of Islam, should we take, so… Oz.

320
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:56.579
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): CLA, executed, and Operated as a…

321
00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:04.340
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): Normal, normal day of, this thing, after that, I…

322
00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:08.260
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): Preferred to, expect that the… we…

323
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:12.170
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): discussing, again, future of the platform.

324
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:19.870
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you, Tosa.

325
00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:20.560
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): Yeah.

326
00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:21.400
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yep.

327
00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:28.729
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And, I've, are there any questions or comments?

328
00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:34.040
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Nothing.

329
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:38.300
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So… Aye?

330
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:43.140
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): think, master-song already introduced, but,

331
00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:50.059
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Next, March, OpenChain Friends event will be, held in…

332
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:55.810
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Bear, I'm sorry, I don't know. Bell… huh? Belly? Or…

333
00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:56.990
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Or Stuttgart.

334
00:51:57.330 --> 00:52:06.900
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'm sorry. So, I highly recommend to attend this event, if you can join.

335
00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:13.660
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Unfortunately, I don't have any budget to draw them, but Ariane will be there.

336
00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:20.209
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): home, my colleagues, and so, I'm very,

337
00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:23.140
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): He got to join. Next slide.

338
00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:37.149
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Yeah, and the first preliminary draft of the program I plan to share this afternoon. So, currently we have only the topic stream abstracts and the keynotes, that are already, confirmed.

339
00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:51.009
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): And this afternoon, you can also have a look more into the details about what's in there for those things that are already confirmed, and we will incrementally update that over the next weeks.

340
00:52:51.200 --> 00:53:06.819
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): That's point number one. Point number two is, yeah, we really intentionally plan that as an in-person event, and we also plan to come to Asia, by the way, with the same format, then by autumn.

341
00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:21.370
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): also Eastern Europe, we try to do, really, get people together, get connects. The downside of that is that, and I… you will see when you see the program, there's a lot of interesting stuff.

342
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:37.360
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): And, you might have the fear to miss it, so we also ask the speakers to use the chance also to do an open-chain webinar afterwards, so that we also have the possibility

343
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:46.799
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): To share their, talks and, have this recording, having also typically then more time also for Q&As at the end.

344
00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:59.790
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): And then it's recorded, because here we do not record anything, it's all in person, it's all, yeah, on-site. But there we hope that we have done the best of both worlds, right, that we have here.

345
00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:15.940
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): possibilities with such kind of events to connect on the other side with the, webinars, and also, possibility to share that after it's online, with… for those who couldn't join, so that you do not,

346
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:39.880
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): miss too much at the end, yeah. But you will miss, obviously, you will miss something. But at least then we can, yeah, hop on the shoulders of those giants that present there also with the webinars. I would have already planned that, to be honest, but I'm still waiting for our next journal manager, because that's a lot of work, and try to figure out, but you can also expect, so we'll try

347
00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:57.619
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): You will see in the program, so it's also worth looking at that, even after the event, where we also try to share in the program, then, the links to the webinars, to the planned webinars, to the recordings, etc, so that you really have a comprehensive overview of all those topics.

348
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:59.879
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much.

349
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:09.509
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Nikola is one of those, yeah, just as a side hint, all those top extremes are organized by the community, yeah, so… so we have…

350
00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:26.219
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): representatives in those, you could call it program committees for all of those topic streams. And Nikola, he's, one of the team members in this open source compliance in Auspos, so he could also provide you then more information if you want, you can contact him.

351
00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:32.679
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): But you will see that anyway, hopefully, later than the… Preliminary, schedule.

352
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:33.670
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

353
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:35.179
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much.

354
00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:38.130
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay…

355
00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:52.930
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you very much, all participants, and, thank you for joining from the SPDX project. It's the first time, I, I think. Thank you very much for joining.

356
00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:56.380
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

357
00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:57.720
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Soap.

358
00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:04.890
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): If there are no questions or comments, I will finish this meeting today.

359
00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.030
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Are there any comments?

360
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:22.429
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Yeah, thank you, Kubota-san. It was great. I think you made a great program agenda today, so thank you very much also for all those updates. It was really great.

361
00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:24.809
