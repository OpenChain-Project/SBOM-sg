00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.310
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

17
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:33.620
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): hello, and thank you for joining open study group. And, as I said today, Shane is having a severe flight delay.

18
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.559
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so he can't join today's meeting. I apologize.

19
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.920
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this meeting held. It's a 3rd session after the Kickoff meeting.

20
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:55.009
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and I will introduce you later today. But Okada-san from West Japan will give a presentation on f 1 from the security perspective

21
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:07.430
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): before starting session. As always, I would like to show the antitrust policy.

22
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.839
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Now, this is an open source community event for the people, belongings to various companies.

23
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.939
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So please do not violate this and trust policy.

24
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:25.689
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And also we, I don't show here the there is a code of conduct in the Linux Foundation.

25
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.950
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so please forward it to

26
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:38.000
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and with the, as you know, cra being issued this month, the S. Vomira is approaching.

27
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:44.770
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and I'm sure that many companies, including you, are actively making efforts.

28
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:52.929
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): However, I heard many opinions that we still have many issues regarding Islamian population.

29
00:09:53.430 --> 00:10:02.570
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Therefore, over the past, several times we have asked you to share what issues you feel and how to approach them.

30
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.980
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And in Japan also stimulate situation.

31
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.330
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And there was an event called the Japanese woman. Summit

32
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:17.499
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): after open source summit in Japan, and the open conference summit, and various efforts were shared

33
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:24.219
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): at the Japan Expo. The efforts of West Japan were introduced.

34
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:30.819
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So today we ask the presenter to share their knowledge and challenges.

35
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:46.419
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And I believe there are few people who have much knowledge about the other community efforts outside the next foundation. So I think it is a great opportunity to hear from Paterson and exchange opinions.

36
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.500
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you, Okanasa. Could you please start your session.

37
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.410
Riotaro OKADA: Okay.

38
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.171
Riotaro OKADA: yeah, I'm a little bit nervous.

39
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:10.180
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah, and nice to meet you all, you guys.

40
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:19.260
Riotaro OKADA: And I'm not good at speaking in English presentation. But so thank you for inviting me to have

41
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:25.970
Riotaro OKADA: my torque in this are great community

42
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:39.859
Riotaro OKADA: today. I don't really want to discuss the difference between Cyclone, Dx and Spdx today. But I think there's some value in doing that kind of research. But

43
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:48.520
Riotaro OKADA: I think either of those is fine, and at least, and not

44
00:11:48.970 --> 00:12:09.939
Riotaro OKADA: on today's agenda, as I mean. So I don't want to reason about the difference between the 2 format, but I want to reason about the common interest about how to deal with vulnerabilities, software vulnerabilities.

45
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:25.509
Riotaro OKADA: So let's start. So please feel free to give me feedback or your reaction throughout the Zoom chat. Can you put some text

46
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.340
Riotaro OKADA: say, Hello or something?

47
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:33.009
Riotaro OKADA: And yeah, and I want to.

48
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.080
Riotaro OKADA: I apologize my poor English.

49
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.149
Riotaro OKADA: So okay, let's start.

50
00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:48.790
Riotaro OKADA: So I'm ryota. Okada asterisk research. And it's Japanese, a company and serving some

51
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:54.130
Riotaro OKADA: application security enhancement or some practice.

52
00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:04.469
Riotaro OKADA: And to encourage P, cert, or wow, productive team, software productive team.

53
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.619
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah, so like this.

54
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:18.240
Riotaro OKADA: And I'm a lifetime member of Owas foundation. And for 2 decades and like for the 2 decades and

55
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:26.839
Riotaro OKADA: so many documentations were translated, our team by our team. So

56
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:33.120
Riotaro OKADA: maybe you know, what's top 10 in Japan?

57
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.020
Riotaro OKADA: Maybe.

58
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.680
Riotaro OKADA: Okay, no reaction.

59
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:39.790
Riotaro OKADA: Okay?

60
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:50.300
Riotaro OKADA: Yes. As you know, Cyclone Dx is a full stacks boom standard. So it it says the cyclone Dx is.

61
00:13:50.510 --> 00:14:01.250
Riotaro OKADA: and very unique from this perspective. So it can deal with hardware and software. At least.

62
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:06.889
Riotaro OKADA: so I want to introduce what cyclone Dx is.

63
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:12.440
Riotaro OKADA: And it looks like, look like, so.

64
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:29.859
Riotaro OKADA: yeah, this is the Cyclon Dx, the scope. It is not only open source software, but also proprietary software and hardware. And nowadays AI cryptography. So it is like Spdx, 3 point X,

65
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.160
Riotaro OKADA: and yeah.

66
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.829
Riotaro OKADA: And so nowadays we should deal with the

67
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:40.139
Riotaro OKADA: transparency of software, component or compositions.

68
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.560
Riotaro OKADA: So the the main purpose is

69
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.229
Riotaro OKADA: not just like is bomb format, but also the

70
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:59.170
Riotaro OKADA: how to exchange the information about software software composition. And so to show that it's transparency right?

71
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:12.759
Riotaro OKADA: And it is community driven. Yeah, it is the very value. Variable things you may think. And siteground. Dx is community driven as well.

72
00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:20.819
Riotaro OKADA: So, and the Wasp Foundation is the backup community. And it is really.

73
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:27.389
Riotaro OKADA: as you know, it is open source software or open source how to put

74
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:38.239
Riotaro OKADA: project the hosting project, and these are more than 200 local chapters, including Japan

75
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:50.430
Riotaro OKADA: in Japan, at least, maybe 7 chapters in Japan or in Japan, so that they are really active. And if you want to join the

76
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:59.000
Riotaro OKADA: my closest community, I can introduce that in Kansai, Kyushu, Okinawa, Hokkaido like that.

77
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.880
Riotaro OKADA: and more more than 200 projects as well.

78
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:19.469
Riotaro OKADA: So this is the difference different from local chapters. So including Wasp, top 10 project, or now recently, we are now struggling with how to deal with Llm.

79
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:27.880
Riotaro OKADA: But Wasp, Llm. Project is really interesting. So if you want to have, I have a look at

80
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:32.859
Riotaro OKADA: that. So it will be very funny thing. Yes.

81
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.250
Riotaro OKADA: Yup.

82
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:50.850
Riotaro OKADA: Oh, so when you want to listen, or the so investigate how.

83
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:56.640
Riotaro OKADA: with about the application security practices. Please take a look on my Youtube channel.

84
00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.899
Riotaro OKADA: Okay? Okay?

85
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.910
Riotaro OKADA: Oh, thank you. The reaction is okay.

86
00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:14.080
Riotaro OKADA: The yeah. Nowadays. S-bomb is a really hot topic. Even in application.

87
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:22.510
Riotaro OKADA: Engineers not only manufacture company that s 1 become just a

88
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:31.899
Riotaro OKADA: started just started. And actually, I use checkmarks, sca, but so it can

89
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:40.120
Riotaro OKADA: display the what component is vulnerable or exploitable, or

90
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.970
Riotaro OKADA: yeah like that. And it can export the

91
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.279
Riotaro OKADA: both of Spdx format and the cyclone Dx format.

92
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.490
Riotaro OKADA: And I took a look at the

93
00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:59.059
Riotaro OKADA: the contents itself Directory, but it is really complicated, and sometimes it is.

94
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.709
Riotaro OKADA: It lacks some metadata.

95
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:32.209
Riotaro OKADA: or that it is not completed. But okay, so I tried to put that data sometimes into the chat. Gpt, so, yeah, so, but it is machine leader. So sometimes the chat Gpt answered some insight to me, and so but it takes maybe more tasks or more cost

96
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:36.530
Riotaro OKADA: to deal with this bomb. So people.

97
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:47.199
Riotaro OKADA: without any information or lecturing or onboarding itself. It is really, it looks a little bit complicated to deal with.

98
00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:49.005
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah.

99
00:18:49.810 --> 00:19:00.810
Riotaro OKADA: So they say, cyclone Dx characteristics thing is to deal with dealing with vulnerabilities.

100
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:10.969
Riotaro OKADA: not only licenses, so it is the specific thing, but so taking a look at the vulnerabilities scope.

101
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:17.590
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah, so it it reads the direct information about the

102
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:31.029
Riotaro OKADA: component and the information that we can. Of course, we can add or reduce some remove, some component inappropriate

103
00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.260
Riotaro OKADA: a field like this. Ma.

104
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:56.379
Riotaro OKADA: so maybe the general understanding of West bomb is now like that. So okay, it is. It looks very important. But so why? It is not so, why it is so important, or Eucra, or like that. So why it is

105
00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:02.500
Riotaro OKADA: so important, or until the compliance level.

106
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.159
Riotaro OKADA: But today I want to reason about.

107
00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:16.219
Riotaro OKADA: And how important is this so again, Cyclone Dx is a full stack boom standard, and

108
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.487
Riotaro OKADA: yes, it is

109
00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:31.050
Riotaro OKADA: It utilized so many enterprises utilize that this format and ecosystem

110
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:37.900
Riotaro OKADA: and so many components represented monthly. So it is.

111
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:46.460
Riotaro OKADA: And yeah, it was sonotype rebooted. Yeah.

112
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:53.239
Riotaro OKADA: And it's community driven. It is like Spdx as well. And

113
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:59.760
Riotaro OKADA: so I suggested. When you are interested in what

114
00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:03.799
Riotaro OKADA: second Dx is, they'll join slack.

115
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:20.020
Riotaro OKADA: So I joined Slack recently, and I could interview some key person. What is cyclone, Dx. And how can utilize that? And what is the difference with what's the difference

116
00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:27.190
Riotaro OKADA: with other formats or history, or something like that? So today.

117
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:48.180
Riotaro OKADA: actually, I'm not that professional about Cyclone Dx, but and I'm not responsible enough to speak on behalf of the entire Wasp community. But I'm just an engineer with a strong interest in a strong interest and mission in software transparency.

118
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:51.150
Riotaro OKADA: So yeah.

119
00:21:51.850 --> 00:22:03.539
Riotaro OKADA: so I had a chance to discuss it. Discuss about Cyclone Dx with some, the core members of the community, this slack on this slack

120
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.349
Riotaro OKADA: and that is promoting Cyclone Dx and including the leaders.

121
00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.449
Riotaro OKADA: You can see the discussion by joining the cyclone. Dx slack.

122
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:24.870
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah, so it will be fruitful, because so I not able to share the all all information I got this month

123
00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:29.680
Riotaro OKADA: in this talk. So. Yes, yep.

124
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:38.260
Riotaro OKADA: But at least I introduced in Cyclone Dx. It is a frag, one of a flagship wasp projects.

125
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:47.000
Riotaro OKADA: And so and maybe yeah, I guess some people are

126
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:59.850
Riotaro OKADA: more familiar with Cyclone Dx than me. And so if this is this event is in person event, I want to

127
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.980
Riotaro OKADA: ask you raise your hand. But yeah.

128
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:14.870
Riotaro OKADA: so and so many companies or projects support the cyclone Dx, so they want to contribute

129
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:19.899
Riotaro OKADA: to how to deal with vulnerabilities, or how to

130
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:29.109
Riotaro OKADA: gather information or concrete information to deal with vulnerabilities, or easier right?

131
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:32.860
Riotaro OKADA: So that it is just like

132
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:41.470
Riotaro OKADA: my hobby. Not not only not hobby project, but not professional project. I want to appeal that.

133
00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.260
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah. And this is really

134
00:23:45.290 --> 00:24:01.049
Riotaro OKADA: good thing. Good news for me or for all cyclone Dx version 1.6 is now, Ecuma standard. Yeah. So this is a really happy thing. So that's because

135
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.389
Riotaro OKADA: anybody want to contribute to this

136
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:12.229
Riotaro OKADA: format. So the this is the internationally standardized and Tc.

137
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.480
Riotaro OKADA: 54 hosted. So

138
00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:30.830
Riotaro OKADA: my, it is so. I expect this standardized format or the standardization drives the cycronics more mature.

139
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:39.439
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah. But but I want to mention about what is the version? 1.7, or what is the challenge?

140
00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:43.530
Riotaro OKADA: For Cyclone Dx, and later

141
00:24:45.750 --> 00:25:02.980
Riotaro OKADA: the cyclone Dx design principle is like that. So it is really good to deal with very simple. And so we don't have any light version of Cyclone Dx, because it is really simple, easy to understand. So without any manual.

142
00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:17.980
Riotaro OKADA: And so when we take a look at the cyclone Dx format, so that we can understand what it want to tell us about the compositions

143
00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:27.330
Riotaro OKADA: in the system. So the so many tools are hosted in Cyclone Dx

144
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:37.340
Riotaro OKADA: website. So please take a look at the Psychron Dx website, it is really easy to access, and we can find various tools. And

145
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:46.590
Riotaro OKADA: and psychrondix scope is really wide. And so the

146
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:57.569
Riotaro OKADA: so we can understand very easily. Psychron, Dx want to focus on the software transparency whole of software transparency?

147
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:06.509
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah. So nowadays, so many things or items or services are. So we our

148
00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:11.339
Riotaro OKADA: on the supply chain risk. So like this.

149
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:23.120
Riotaro OKADA: And Ma. So I discussed some, the key persons and the cyclone Dx professionals

150
00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:31.860
Riotaro OKADA: and the core developers. So they introduced to utilize owasp dependency track.

151
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:54.139
Riotaro OKADA: It is tool name, this tool by using these tools, and we can deal with cyclone Dx format, or the Sbom or software transparency in conceptual way. So if you want to try this

152
00:26:54.590 --> 00:27:01.590
Riotaro OKADA: ecosystem, so maybe you may utilize this wasp dependency track.

153
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.130
Riotaro OKADA: Yes, not just the information.

154
00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:07.660
Riotaro OKADA: So today's topic might.

155
00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.780
Riotaro OKADA: Agenda is like this, if we keep

156
00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:16.939
Riotaro OKADA: updating software, will we no longer be at risk of vulnerabilities?

157
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:41.560
Riotaro OKADA: This is a very logical question, because nowadays we can see the software version. So Apache, 1.0 point something or some other project name, if you like. And this is the project name. And it's like a tag

158
00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:53.060
Riotaro OKADA: as tag the version name version number. Yeah. So this version has tons of vulnerabilities. So we should update something

159
00:27:54.360 --> 00:28:06.470
Riotaro OKADA: like that. So but the updating is just only way to conquer software vulnerabilities.

160
00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:16.330
Riotaro OKADA: And, as you know, unresolved issue there separating risk.

161
00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:17.450
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah.

162
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.870
Riotaro OKADA: So let's let's drill down about the supply chain risk.

163
00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:33.260
Riotaro OKADA: Yes. So let us define what is supply chain risk in the software.

164
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:41.190
Riotaro OKADA: I tried as this right, the risk posed by an attacker's method

165
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:44.590
Riotaro OKADA: or a malicious person method of

166
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:51.040
Riotaro OKADA: inserting maress code or entire maress components into trusted software or hardware.

167
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:55.340
Riotaro OKADA: So the do you trust open source software?

168
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.320
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah. Okay.

169
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:00.883
Riotaro OKADA: Hmm, hmm!

170
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:02.455
Riotaro OKADA: But

171
00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:09.740
Riotaro OKADA: So I don't mean it is not trustworthy, but the so. But when we

172
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:17.319
Riotaro OKADA: see it is trustworthy, so that we should have the this.

173
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.150
Riotaro OKADA: my 3 points, 3 risk points.

174
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.679
Riotaro OKADA: The one is our Ss as a target.

175
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:33.199
Riotaro OKADA: according to initial threat, landscape 202-42-0024,

176
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:47.340
Riotaro OKADA: 24. So some points related to software vulnerabilities are a target of attackers, cyber attackers.

177
00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.800
Riotaro OKADA: So this is my real risk.

178
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:58.750
Riotaro OKADA: And nowadays so many enterprise systems utilize the open source software.

179
00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:09.439
Riotaro OKADA: and so many opens if the open source software is not so trustworthy or some component is outdated.

180
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.130
Riotaro OKADA: So this is real risk of enterprises

181
00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:20.280
Riotaro OKADA: so, and it was really successful. It has been successful for

182
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:32.860
Riotaro OKADA: hackers, so that this is the fact, and the so hackers sometimes insert

183
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:36.840
Riotaro OKADA: or inject some their Mauritius code

184
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:40.669
Riotaro OKADA: into open source software very easily.

185
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:55.819
Riotaro OKADA: sometimes not type of squatting is a typical thing so very famous. We, if we want to utilize some famous open source software project

186
00:30:56.050 --> 00:31:06.720
Riotaro OKADA: and and using some software repository. But sometimes we type typo right now.

187
00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:20.480
Riotaro OKADA: So and in Japanese not are generally not good at the exact typing. So joke I'm kidding. But

188
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:25.550
Riotaro OKADA: anyway, so open source software repository is just now

189
00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:31.820
Riotaro OKADA: the target of hackers and so many ways to hack.

190
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:37.510
Riotaro OKADA: So I mean, it is not professional hacking programming, but also

191
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:42.590
Riotaro OKADA: it is the intruding or the maneuvering.

192
00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:48.839
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah, so many risks are there like this.

193
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:58.789
Riotaro OKADA: So I don't want to read all of these, but so many newss. And my investigations

194
00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:08.509
Riotaro OKADA: are appeals. So nowadays open source software repositories are not so completely safe

195
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:18.169
Riotaro OKADA: and malware in project or protest, where in project or the yeah geopolitical thing

196
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:36.039
Riotaro OKADA: affect the peace of open source software repositories. But people, when people update the latest version, latest version, latest version. So the Mauritius code expand, step-by-step manner.

197
00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:39.949
Riotaro OKADA: Right? So this is really severe thing. So what is

198
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:50.150
Riotaro OKADA: trustworthy so distinguish what is trustworthy or not is a really important thing nowadays, because Oss is as a target

199
00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.680
Riotaro OKADA: and secondary.

200
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:59.600
Riotaro OKADA: And now low security maturity of oss developers. This is a really radical program.

201
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.350
Riotaro OKADA: So maybe it is a very common program.

202
00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:08.870
Riotaro OKADA: So we'll look for all of us like this.

203
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:18.580
Riotaro OKADA: Noticed opens Ssf report released in last August.

204
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:22.680
Riotaro OKADA: The survey data reveals that nearly 1 3rd of professionals

205
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:32.615
Riotaro OKADA: report feeling unfamiliar with the secure software development practices. This is the really shocking thing, because,

206
00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:39.100
Riotaro OKADA: so very, it is not good thing

207
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:42.809
Riotaro OKADA: the airm engines now support to

208
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.800
Riotaro OKADA: produce code, right? So they're co-pilots

209
00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:52.969
Riotaro OKADA: or casar, or something like that. So it is really good teacher.

210
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:59.620
Riotaro OKADA: And so they, the tools like these gave us

211
00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:12.260
Riotaro OKADA: give will give us some good hints to implement something right? But they're learning. Data was has been

212
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:14.460
Riotaro OKADA: open source software.

213
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:20.790
Riotaro OKADA: But 70% of open source software is

214
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:30.050
Riotaro OKADA: has no, not sufficient code reviews or very high risk area.

215
00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.659
Riotaro OKADA: And the code itself is not so mature.

216
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:34.210
Riotaro OKADA: Right?

217
00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:44.840
Riotaro OKADA: So this is very sad story. And so 1 point we should do is

218
00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:53.069
Riotaro OKADA: to encourage the open source software programmer to study about the security and the secure to have to

219
00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:56.540
Riotaro OKADA: implement their code in a secure way.

220
00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:05.629
Riotaro OKADA: So this is a very big challenge. So we know. So there are so many approach or so many efforts

221
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:11.659
Riotaro OKADA: are ongoing. But so it is, the current very big.

222
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:20.019
Riotaro OKADA: The big issue to utilize open source software, right or open source software project.

223
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.579
Riotaro OKADA: The 3rd point is users who blindly trust updates

224
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.149
Riotaro OKADA: so and it is based on

225
00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:34.649
Riotaro OKADA: one oss as a target, 2, a low security maturity of Oss developers.

226
00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:45.910
Riotaro OKADA: So the on this a situation that if there only there only

227
00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:50.679
Riotaro OKADA: users who blindly trust updates, it is very sad story.

228
00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:58.119
Riotaro OKADA: So the let's take a look at about the resolution of vulnerability.

229
00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:09.839
Riotaro OKADA: So so as users, so we we should have. We may might have the smartphone right like this.

230
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:15.326
Riotaro OKADA: So many applications in this in this device, the the.

231
00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:25.060
Riotaro OKADA: So if you want to. If if you use android, please raise your hand.

232
00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:27.990
Riotaro OKADA: No.

233
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.975
Riotaro OKADA: And the iphone, okay? So he's okay. Okay, thank you.

234
00:36:34.136 --> 00:36:34.803
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah.

235
00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:44.739
Riotaro OKADA: Anyway. So okay, I'm very happy to see your reaction. And anyway, so we

236
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:50.390
Riotaro OKADA: update so many applications every day. Right?

237
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.810
Riotaro OKADA: So and do you update every day?

238
00:36:55.953 --> 00:37:10.306
Riotaro OKADA: It's no more thing. So and not only be, because vulnerability. But also there's some new feature we want to. Yeah, yeah, automatic updates, it's okay. Yeah.

239
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:20.800
Riotaro OKADA: So updating is really essential for users, because the this is the only way to have the more stable

240
00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:32.770
Riotaro OKADA: stable or might improve our environment and the using environment user experiences. Right?

241
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:36.350
Riotaro OKADA: So the it depends on the vendor.

242
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:46.680
Riotaro OKADA: So ma, including me. So ma, I support some manufacturers, manufacturers

243
00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:51.519
Riotaro OKADA: and the software suppliers. So the

244
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.659
Riotaro OKADA: from this point point of view.

245
00:37:56.706 --> 00:38:04.103
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah. So I am one over there. And okay, so 70, 30.

246
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.729
Riotaro OKADA: Okay, platform chat. Let's go on.

247
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.660
Riotaro OKADA: But taking a look at the software.

248
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:22.209
Riotaro OKADA: the more software, the system, the open source. 3rd party Apis, we should change the verification operation and application update

249
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:32.960
Riotaro OKADA: and the program when we code some program. So we should fix double vulnerability in the code and the

250
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:43.230
Riotaro OKADA: but some so many components. And the program code is depending on or connected with a configuration

251
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:57.060
Riotaro OKADA: or protocol. So it means when we see the open source software security, we should know the how to

252
00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:07.090
Riotaro OKADA: the version, of course, but how to utilize that or the program code is, of course, the expected

253
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:16.380
Riotaro OKADA: to fix the vulnerability. But we can check the program code directory, but so nobody check the

254
00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:23.970
Riotaro OKADA: the difference or diff, or the patch of cold.

255
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:34.359
Riotaro OKADA: whether it could fix the vulnerability correctly or properly right.

256
00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.660
Riotaro OKADA: So now, of course, there's somebody.

257
00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:54.370
Riotaro OKADA: What did that? Or checked that? But so maybe so many. Most of users don't care about the okay. The new version will be nicer than older version or the

258
00:39:54.590 --> 00:40:01.519
Riotaro OKADA: release note. So we fixed the vulnerability. But the user most users

259
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:07.370
Riotaro OKADA: don't check about into check into the code drill down into code.

260
00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:25.050
Riotaro OKADA: So this is very big problem. Because 1 3rd of open source software, professional don't want to code security or are not interested in secure coding. Right? So it is big program, very headache program. So

261
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:31.769
Riotaro OKADA: so when and software composition analysis.

262
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:42.940
Riotaro OKADA: we do. And actually I sell. But but so we don't be. We shouldn't be satisfied with just finding program components.

263
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:49.029
Riotaro OKADA: and that the only the tag did it is really risky or not.

264
00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.709
Riotaro OKADA: But so we should drill down more

265
00:40:52.750 --> 00:41:08.849
Riotaro OKADA: like the perspectives on whether to continue to use or not. Right? So we should. Sometimes we should drill down the project or so the code it is

266
00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:17.650
Riotaro OKADA: appropriate, and to it is a right to think

267
00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:24.009
Riotaro OKADA: whether it is right thing to continue to utilize this a project or not.

268
00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:32.020
Riotaro OKADA: So I want to show I want to introduce one project, the software Heritage project.

269
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.789
Riotaro OKADA: And do you know the software? This project?

270
00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:37.280
Riotaro OKADA: So

271
00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:46.490
Riotaro OKADA: I recently, I met a core person of a software heritage project. Yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you. Thank you.

272
00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:51.900
Riotaro OKADA: And this is archive project of various

273
00:41:52.070 --> 00:42:01.690
Riotaro OKADA: repositories, and it increasing, including the patch or the who provide that patch or the

274
00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:09.970
Riotaro OKADA: yeah. So I I mean, so we can track the engineers so to the detail.

275
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:21.260
Riotaro OKADA: So if when we drill down the software project, or we want to check the reputation like the

276
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:25.420
Riotaro OKADA: frequency to update or the quality of update.

277
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:32.360
Riotaro OKADA: So we can my track the some, the and

278
00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:53.839
Riotaro OKADA: historical records throughout this project. So it is really useful to check. If a certain project is really trustworthy, or if certain engineers or programmer is really trustworthy or something.

279
00:42:53.870 --> 00:43:01.729
Riotaro OKADA: So it is really good news for me. And I want. So that's why I wanted to introduce this

280
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:03.280
Riotaro OKADA: a project to you.

281
00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:13.070
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah. So I'm very happy. Yeah, you know, you know, you most of you know software Heritage project. But so it is really good usage

282
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:16.580
Riotaro OKADA: about that. This project. Yes.

283
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:31.420
Riotaro OKADA: yeah. Back to Cyclone Dx, the Cyclone Dx project released. Very good S bomb tools. And so oh, no, no.

284
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:39.290
Riotaro OKADA: So please take a look and download this and a tot.

285
00:43:42.510 --> 00:44:06.360
Riotaro OKADA: I didn't translate into Japanese, but I want to try, or I want to encourage our team to translate into Japanese. But nowadays the cost to read or utilize English materials is really low. So I want to encourage Japanese people to read the

286
00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:15.120
Riotaro OKADA: some guidelines or guides from cyclone. Dx is ready.

287
00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:21.340
Riotaro OKADA: easy to understand it. And a really reasonable thing. So and I want to encourage.

288
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:24.580
Riotaro OKADA: yeah, these are now available.

289
00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:30.449
Riotaro OKADA: Yes, and I want to mention Darwestry. Yes, thank you.

290
00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:34.069
Riotaro OKADA: You've done this. Oh, thank you very much.

291
00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:41.080
Riotaro OKADA: And I want to mention about the challenge of Cyclone Dx. Lastly, the

292
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:45.860
Riotaro OKADA: one thing is that despite wide adoption.

293
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:50.620
Riotaro OKADA: and there is a lack of public case studies

294
00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:58.670
Riotaro OKADA: and so collaboration with the organization to produce and share these, these is needed. This is one challenge

295
00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:12.390
Riotaro OKADA: and tool classification is the second challenge. The cyclone Dx tool center hosting over 250 tools requires reclassifications and updates to improve

296
00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:21.660
Riotaro OKADA: usability. Yeah, so many tools. But it is a little bit chaotic. So I felt, yeah.

297
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:31.990
Riotaro OKADA: And the so second Ds can deal with hardware. Yeah. So I told you. But

298
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:43.670
Riotaro OKADA: limited input from device and hardware makers, constrains bomb format optimization for hardware needs. This is a 3rd challenge.

299
00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:47.570
Riotaro OKADA: I interviewed them so it will be true. Yeah.

300
00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:48.700
Riotaro OKADA: So

301
00:45:49.250 --> 00:46:14.010
Riotaro OKADA: the so and recruiting additional maintenance to support its expanding ecosystem. So the cyclone Dx is open and the community driven. So the challenge is has been to recruiting additional maintainers or the ecosystem contributors. So I want to be.

302
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:27.979
Riotaro OKADA: But so the. As for Cyclone Dx, the challenge is like this so? Well, I I think that's simply

303
00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:31.600
Riotaro OKADA: hmm to.

304
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:39.480
Riotaro OKADA: I hope.

305
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:41.650
Riotaro OKADA: Yup.

306
00:46:44.670 --> 00:47:09.749
Riotaro OKADA: I hope everyone in Japan will be interested in wasps activities. We will have another contact somewhere. So please gather information through Twitter and other means. So we also have a mailing list and a slack channel. And I encourage all of you guys to join the Cyclone Dx community as well.

307
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:16.350
Riotaro OKADA: Please take a look at the document, the slide deck, which I hope to share in some way later.

308
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.870
Riotaro OKADA: and

309
00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:39.609
Riotaro OKADA: it's difficult to exchange business card today. So I'm in on Linkedin or Twitter. Yeah. So I would appreciate it if you could follow me on Twitter or connect on Linkedin. Also, if you would like to email me with feedback.

310
00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:53.280
Riotaro OKADA: and don't mention about my silly English. But maybe you kindly focus on my content. So I would really appreciate it. And I look forward to working with you in the future.

311
00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:57.589
Riotaro OKADA: And so thank you very much for your time today.

312
00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:11.820
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much, Okraham, and I very appreciate it. And are there any questions and comments

313
00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.250
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): from attendees?

314
00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:20.538
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So I have one question.

315
00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:21.350
Riotaro OKADA: Okay.

316
00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:30.630
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Many people from many countries. So I I'd like to ask you, are there any other local chapters.

317
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:37.509
Riotaro OKADA: Oh, local chapters, and from all over the world, right.

318
00:48:38.207 --> 00:48:40.710
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, other than the Japan chapters.

319
00:48:42.153 --> 00:48:43.259
Riotaro OKADA: Japan. Chapter.

320
00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:46.170
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Other than Jeff. Jump on chapters.

321
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.879
Riotaro OKADA: Other other than Japan Japanese. Okay, thank you.

322
00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:59.700
Riotaro OKADA: Okay, so please take Erica Wasborg and talk and the

323
00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:10.689
Riotaro OKADA: chapters right chapters. So there are so many chapters now listed on this. And yeah. So

324
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:39.130
Riotaro OKADA: the chapter based meeting is really frequent, like monthly or quarterly. So you can very easy to find application security team or the application security guys, and not only the application, but also the manufacturing. So please, I want to encourage you to if you are manufacturer. So the project

325
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:44.759
Riotaro OKADA: browse like that. So sometimes we can enjoy the

326
00:49:46.050 --> 00:50:00.699
Riotaro OKADA: to IoT or money for money manufacturer, or, if you are now the very interested in Llm. So you can search the Llm. Project.

327
00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:02.150
Riotaro OKADA: The

328
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:18.550
Riotaro OKADA: so so many up to date project are there, and they have only they have own slack channel or the communication tool like that. So maybe maybe most of

329
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:26.029
Riotaro OKADA: most project has owned their project or the Wasp slack

330
00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:46.320
Riotaro OKADA: and their own channel right? And but the cyclone Dx is independent, slack channel so that you can enjoy that. So it is really funny. And so many open source software key persons are now gathering on the

331
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:57.069
Riotaro OKADA: this cyclone Dx Channel. So maybe you can find you are a very familiar person in in this track, so I want to invite you, all of you.

332
00:50:57.110 --> 00:51:06.470
Riotaro OKADA: So to discuss and corroborate. I exchanged some information or ideas, and and but

333
00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:32.470
Riotaro OKADA: concepts it would be very nice, even me. So I'm very strange for them, but so they welcomed me, and so they answered my interview very frequently and easily, even I am Japanese. But yeah, like this. So this is really open project. So if you are now dealing with S-bomb various way.

334
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:45.000
Riotaro OKADA: or if you're not so apart from Xbomb, but you are now interested in software transparency. Maybe it will be very beneficial to join and discuss with them.

335
00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.300
Riotaro OKADA: Okay.

336
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:48.570
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah, thank you very much.

337
00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:54.270
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay. Any other graph. 2 comments.

338
00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.290
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): nothing.

339
00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:09.970
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): So maybe if nobody else has anything to ask like, you mentioned the software heritage

340
00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:17.260
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): and how to use that to get, let's say, historical information about the project. How does that

341
00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:23.509
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): differentiate from what chaos project is doing? If all? Are you familiar with the chaos project?

342
00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:34.140
Riotaro OKADA: I'm sorry I know the name of project, but I'm not familiar with that project. So it is up to you.

343
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:35.450
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Okay. Yeah.

344
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:36.170
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah.

345
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:42.830
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): So maybe maybe a question like, how have you been using the software heritage to to gather the information.

346
00:52:43.590 --> 00:53:02.740
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah, actually. So I I am one of the security guy. So and I have, even, I have been software pro programmer. But I wanted to check to about the protest where, in my case.

347
00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:10.089
Riotaro OKADA: so the I want to track some some developers or the

348
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:17.389
Riotaro OKADA: people people. A person who was involved

349
00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:32.129
Riotaro OKADA: involved to involve the protest where or malware deployment, so that I wanted to track that this, this, the same person, is now now

350
00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:34.999
Riotaro OKADA: contributed. Other project or not

351
00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:47.279
Riotaro OKADA: like that. So this is really rare case, maybe from your point of view. But so it is. It was really useful, and I could find some other risky point.

352
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:49.850
Riotaro OKADA: and they are so.

353
00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:53.840
Riotaro OKADA: So. It is one story I utilize that project.

354
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:58.580
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Perfect. Thank you, and I see Marcel has his hand up.

355
00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:05.629
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Yeah, thank you very much so, and thank you for your presentation. That was really great. And also I.

356
00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:10.789
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Your English is probably better than mine, so excuse me now for my question.

357
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:11.680
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah.

358
00:54:12.077 --> 00:54:36.739
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Or or this German. My my daughter always called it potato English that we we talk. But yeah, as as you know, we heard in the S bomb group from from open chain. So our main goal is now to to have a focus on the supply chain, right? So how we hand over from along from upstream to downstream.

359
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:51.089
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): and where we try also to be agnostic to the, to the final format, if they may be Spd cyclonics hash id whatever. Yeah. So there are several. So we want to really concentrate on on the contents.

360
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:56.869
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): And I think that will also have potential impact on all of those

361
00:54:57.020 --> 00:55:22.180
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): formats, at least, that we ideally should sit together right and and talk about it. And what would you recommend? What would be a good entry point for such discussions when we say, Hey! On from the Spoon Tooling study group, we would expect all those contents that are handed over along the supply chain. Is there any?

362
00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:30.260
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Yeah architect who would be a contact point? Is it you? Or is it? Yeah, that would be my question.

363
00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:37.562
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah, ma, as an individual.

364
00:55:38.680 --> 00:56:00.120
Riotaro OKADA: Yes, it is really good opportunity you invite kindly invited me to share my idea. Even. I am Japanese, and not so good at speak. But it is good idea to invite some core person from Cyclone Dx to your community, and

365
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:08.770
Riotaro OKADA: if you, if you are not. You don't mind. So let's go to the cyclone Dx community.

366
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:17.690
Riotaro OKADA: And because this is not competitive thing, and it is re collaborate right?

367
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:34.019
Riotaro OKADA: So the corroborate and the change discussion or, yeah. So the the so one purpose, various way, would be welcome. Right? So so the this discuss about the

368
00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:39.189
Riotaro OKADA: so the it is really good thing. So, ma, I hope

369
00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:43.350
Riotaro OKADA: it is really good. One step to corroborate together

370
00:56:43.400 --> 00:57:03.150
Riotaro OKADA: and to get some transparency, because Eucra as well. Now, of course the Us. Has some compliance, and then Japan will maybe should follow these compliances. This is a really good

371
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:13.489
Riotaro OKADA: trigger to corroborate that so. But the main purpose. I think the main purpose is how to get the transparency of software.

372
00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:14.340
Riotaro OKADA: Yeah.

373
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:20.479
Riotaro OKADA: And the S-bomb is not the goal.

374
00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:32.189
Riotaro OKADA: I guess it is too complicated, and it is very immature, not mature a way, but it is the 1st step to get

375
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:36.960
Riotaro OKADA: our 1st step to discuss about the transparency of

376
00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:41.249
Riotaro OKADA: as a software or system or product. Right?

377
00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:49.469
Riotaro OKADA: So from this point of view, the corroboration or the discuss, some information, discuss some

378
00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:56.910
Riotaro OKADA: concept is very useful for the how to get the common goal right? So the

379
00:57:56.970 --> 00:58:06.049
Riotaro OKADA: I don't know the what is the appropriate project, or the body or community or place.

380
00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:15.400
Riotaro OKADA: but so we can make that, or we can corroborate that. So so the now let's go together.

381
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:18.590
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): What do you think?

382
00:58:18.590 --> 00:58:19.309
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I agree.

383
00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:20.130
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Good spirit.

384
00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:25.430
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Market, and please take care.

385
00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:40.699
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yes, so I'm just wanted to mention something is that in India they have published now an S bomb guide.

386
00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:50.849
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): I have guidelines. I've put a link in the chat, and I send it also on the mailing list

387
00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:57.809
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): a few days ago, so you can have a look at this

388
00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:02.209
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): at this as bomb guidelines. Document for for India.

389
00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:03.910
Riotaro OKADA: Thank you.

390
00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:08.709
Riotaro OKADA: I would check.

391
00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.829
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah, thank you.

392
00:59:14.895 --> 00:59:18.779
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Are there any other questions and comments?

393
00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.050
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): There's nothing.

394
00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:25.839
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much. Okrasan. Big hands.

395
00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.920
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you.

396
00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:30.990
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

397
00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:38.280
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): We have 10 min left, and okay, I'll

398
00:59:39.106 --> 00:59:48.309
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'll share my idea for the next meeting, and I will close this meeting, and I have a

399
00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:53.320
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'd like to ask all of you from

400
00:59:53.600 --> 01:00:17.429
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): past few meetings we share the knowledges and insights, and so on. And from the next meeting I'd like to start a specific discussion on how to use S bomb. And what should we do, or how? What should we create such as a guideline? And so on

401
01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:23.709
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and in the past few days talk from ninja, from

402
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.019
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): yes, sir. Are are you here

403
01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:34.470
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): interesting? Shared the material and the blueprint to the mail list.

404
01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:42.359
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and of course there is Telco asthma guide we have. So

405
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:50.430
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): from the it is a good start point we've seen, and I think, and Shane mentioned as well.

406
01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.979
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So we'd like to. I'd like to start with the

407
01:00:56.682 --> 01:01:01.177
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): from the discussion or standing on the Brooklyn.

408
01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:07.230
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So I will draft next time.

409
01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:14.500
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and I I will share the on the github, or slack, or a mail list.

410
01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:20.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so please let us know your opinion or your thoughts.

411
01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.250
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay?

412
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:26.359
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And of course there are some. There are some.

413
01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:44.740
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): If you want to make a presentation or some knowledge to be shared. Please let us know we will. I com. I communicate. I consult with Shane, and make a arranging schedule.

414
01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:46.229
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Please let us know.

415
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:50.329
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, that's all from me.

416
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:58.460
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And thank you again, Okada-san, let's communicate keeping that in the near in future.

417
01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:01.289
