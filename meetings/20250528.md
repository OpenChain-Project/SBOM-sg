### Overall Summary
The meeting began with an update on the progress of the Telco SBOM work and related validator tool enhancements. Participants discussed the strong industry response received during a recent webinar, the formal support from Scanoss for the Telco Guide, and the rationale behind selecting SPDX over CycloneDx. In addition, an updated SBOM document (SBOM Quality Guide) was introduced and reviewed, focusing on a cross-industry, format-agnostic approach.  
The discussion also covered technical issues related to document metadata, the use of various identifiers (such as SPDXID, SWID, and SWHID), and the need for further coordination via GitHub for document revisions and feedback collection.  

### Discussion

- Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation)
  - Opened the meeting by greeting participants and congratulated the Telco SBOM group.
  - Shared a positive update from a recent webinar and noted that Scanoss has formally endorsed the Telco Guide.
  - Announced the forthcoming enhancements to the validator tool (including recursive validation and the ability to list "no assertion" values).
  - Chat: Posted a link to "https://www.scanoss.com/post/the-openchain-telco-sbom" for further background.
  - Commented that due to an overlapping meeting he might leave early and asked to be contacted via email for any action items.

- Marc‑Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation)
  - Explained during the briefing to the U.S. Government (CISA) why SPDX was chosen instead of also including CycloneDx.
  - Cited extensive experience with SPDX and its status as an ISO standard as key reasons for its adoption.
  - Mentioned that the current validator improvements (including recursive validation and minor releases) will address technical issues.
  - Chat: Shared links "https://www.swhid.org/" and noted that the SWHID has been published as the ISO/IEC standard 18670 on April 23, 2025.
  - Reacted to other participants’ comments and clarified technical differences between identifiers.

- Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation)
  - Presented the updated SBOM document (SBOM Quality Guide) and outlined revisions based on previous meetings.  
    https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/OpenChain-JWG/blob/master/subgroups/sbom-sg/outcomes/QualityGuide/SBOM-Document-Quality-Guide.en.md  
  - Described changes in the preface and chapters to reflect a cross-industry and format-agnostic perspective.  
  - Raised questions about the description of security specifications and the distinction between various document formats and identifiers (e.g., SPDX, CycloneDx, SWID/SWHID).
  - Announced the intention to publish the updated document on GitHub and to create a directory for sample JSON files and JSON Schema files.
  - Chat: Posted a GitHub URL "https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/SBOM-sg/tree/main/Cross-Industry-SBOM-Quality-Guide" with further details on document location.
  - Asked for feedback and suggestions regarding the document and technical clarifications.

- Jari Koivisto (ADI)
  - Commented on the discussion regarding the separation between the SBOM document and the SBOM itself.
  - Expressed a personal view that having a division between these two might be useful.
  - Chat: Reacted with a thumbs-up and left his view in support of the discussion.

- Rakesh Prabhakaran (Bosch Global Software Technologies Private Limited)
  - Inquired about details related to the granularity specifications in the document and the support for CycloneDx schema.
  - Suggested the possibility of using standard SPDX identifiers to uniquely distinguish packages.
  - Raised questions about the conditions under which a package’s metadata satisfies granularity requirements.
  - Chat: Reacted by asking clarifying questions and provided suggestions regarding identifier uniqueness.

- Nobuyuki Tanaka (Sony Group Corporation)
  - Offered comments on the granularity and metadata issues, noting some uncertainties in confirming the current status.
  - Agreed that additional details are needed to resolve inconsistencies in metadata across tools.
  - Chat: Provided supportive remarks on the need for further discussion on granularity and metadata standards.

### Results and TODOs

- Confirm the continued use of SPDX based on its extensive team experience and ISO standard status.
- Enhance the validator tool with recursive validation and the option to list "no assertion" values; follow-up communications to be provided with further details.
- Publish the updated SBOM document (SBOM Quality Guide) on GitHub and notify all participants of its location.
- Create a dedicated GitHub directory for sample JSON files and JSON Schema files and share the URL for review.
- Invite all participants to review the published document, provide feedback, and submit pull requests or issues to address technical concerns (especially regarding document metadata and identifier usage).
- Schedule a follow-up technical discussion to further clarify:
  - The differences and usage criteria between SPDX and CycloneDx.
  - The proper handling and uniqueness of identifiers such as SPDX ID, SWID, and SWHID.
  - The specific conditions that indicate whether a package’s granularity meets the required metadata standards.
- Disseminate additional links and background information (e.g., related URLs from the chat history) to support further review and discussion.
