## This is an overview of a brainstorm about a cross-industry SBOM Quality Guide

Building on the OpenChain Telco SBOM Guide, which defined SBOM Quality considerations for the telecommunications supply chain, there is an active discussion in the OpenChain SBOM Study Group about the potential for an expanded cross-industry guide. 

Such a guide would:

1. Be built off the foundation of the OpenChain Telco SBOM Guide
2. Explicitly include cross-industry and cross-format concerns around SBOM management

In this folder you will find a copy of the brainstorm document. 

You can track the discussion via the OpenChain SBOM Study Group mailing list:
